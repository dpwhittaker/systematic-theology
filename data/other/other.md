Not everyone organizes theology the same way.

Alternative approaches:
- *Narrative Theology* - Following the Bible's story arc
- *Biblical Theology* - Tracing themes through Scripture chronologically
- *Historical Theology* - Understanding doctrines through church history
- *Practical Theology* - Starting with lived experience
- *Liberation Theology* - Theology from the margins
- *Systematic* - The traditional categorical approach

Each method reveals and obscures. Each organizes differently.

The question: Does the *method* shape the *message*?
