title: Resurrection

[Eschatology](#eschatology/eschatology 'Parent')

Bodily resurrection—not escape from the body, but its redemption.

**The hope:** Not disembodied existence in heaven, but new bodies in new creation.

**Jesus's resurrection:** The firstfruits, the prototype. His body was transformed—physical yet different. So will ours be.

**1 Corinthians 15:** Without resurrection, faith is futile. This is the heart of Christian hope.

# Resurrection: The Heart of Christian Hope

"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17).

Resurrection is not peripheral. It is central to the gospel.

## Why Resurrection Matters

**1. It validates Jesus's claims**

Romans 1:4: Jesus was "declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead."

If Jesus stayed dead, He was wrong about everything. His resurrection vindicates Him.

**2. It defeats death**

1 Corinthians 15:26: "The last enemy to be destroyed is death."

Death entered through sin. Resurrection reverses death. The enemy is conquered.

**3. It guarantees our future**

1 Corinthians 15:20: "Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."

Firstfruits implies a harvest to follow. His resurrection guarantees ours.

**4. It affirms embodied existence**

If salvation were souls escaping bodies, why resurrection? God redeems whole persons—bodies included.

## Jesus's Resurrection Body

The Gospels describe a body that was:

**Physical/material:**
- He could be touched (John 20:27)
- He ate fish (Luke 24:42-43)
- He had flesh and bones (Luke 24:39)

**Yet transformed:**
- He appeared through locked doors (John 20:19)
- He was not immediately recognizable (Luke 24:16; John 20:14)
- He ascended bodily to heaven (Acts 1:9)

**Neither ghost nor resuscitation:** Not a spirit without body, nor merely a revived corpse that would die again. Something new—physical yet glorified.

## Our Resurrection Bodies

1 Corinthians 15:35-49 addresses: "With what kind of body do they come?"

**Continuity:** It is *your* body that is raised. "It is sown... it is raised" (v. 42-44). Same body, transformed.

**Discontinuity:** "What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable" (v. 42). Radical transformation.

**The contrasts:**
- Perishable → Imperishable (no more decay)
- Dishonor → Glory (radiant, not shameful)
- Weakness → Power (no more frailty)
- Natural body → Spiritual body (animated by Spirit, not merely alive)

**"Spiritual body":** Not immaterial, but Spirit-empowered. As the natural body is animated by *psyche* (soul/life), the resurrection body is animated by *pneuma* (Spirit). Fully physical, fully Spirit-filled.

## When Does Resurrection Happen?

**At Christ's return:**
1 Thessalonians 4:16: "The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command... and the dead in Christ will rise first."

1 Corinthians 15:52: "At the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable."

**All humanity:**
John 5:28-29: "An hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."

Resurrection is not just for believers. All are raised—to different destinies.

## Greek vs. Hebrew Perspectives

**Greek (Platonic) view:**
- The soul is naturally immortal
- Death frees the soul from the body
- Resurrection seems unnecessary (why re-imprison the soul?)
- Heaven as disembodied bliss

**Hebrew view:**
- Humans are embodied beings
- Death is enemy, not liberation
- Resurrection is essential for life after death
- Hope is new creation, not escape from creation

**The early church wrestled with this.** Greek converts found bodily resurrection strange (Acts 17:32: "When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked"). But the apostles insisted: no resurrection, no salvation.

## Resurrection and Judgment

Resurrection is unto judgment:

**Daniel 12:2:** "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."

**John 5:29:** "Those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."

All are raised. Not all to the same destiny. Resurrection bodies for eternal life; resurrection bodies for eternal [judgment](#eschatology/judgment 'Drill').

## The First and Second Resurrection

Revelation 20:4-6 speaks of:

**First resurrection:** Those who reign with Christ for a thousand years. "Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power."

**Second resurrection:** After the millennium, for final judgment (Revelation 20:12-13).

**Interpretations vary:**
- Premillennialists: Two literal resurrections separated by the millennium
- Amillennialists: First resurrection is spiritual (new birth or martyrs' souls in heaven); second is physical/final

## Implications

**1. Bodies matter now**

If God will resurrect our bodies, how we treat bodies matters. Sexual ethics, healthcare, stewardship—all have eternal significance.

**2. This world matters**

Resurrection affirms creation's goodness. God doesn't trash the material world but redeems it.

**3. Hope is concrete**

Not floating on clouds, but embodied life in new creation. Eating, drinking, working, worshiping—with resurrection bodies in resurrection world.

**4. Death is not final**

The grave is not the end. "O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?" (1 Corinthians 15:55).

## The Promise

"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live" (John 11:25).

The same Jesus who walked out of the tomb promises to raise His people. This is not metaphor. This is the hope of Christianity.
