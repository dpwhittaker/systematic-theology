[Eschatology](#eschatology/eschatology 'Parent')

Not escape from creation, but its redemption.

**The hope:** New heavens and new earth—not replacement but renewal. Eden restored and surpassed.

**Revelation 21:5:** "Behold, I am making all things new"—not "all new things."

**Greek tendency:** Heaven as escape from material world. Disembodied souls in spiritual realm.

**Hebrew vision:** Creation healed. Bodies resurrected. God dwelling with His people on renewed earth.

# New Creation: All Things Made New

"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away" (Revelation 21:1).

The end of the biblical story is not escape from creation but its glorious renewal.

## Not Destruction but Renewal

**2 Peter 3:10-13:** "The heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved... But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."

**Two interpretations:**

**1. Annihilation and replacement:**
God destroys this creation entirely and makes a completely new one from scratch.

**2. Transformation and renewal:**
God purifies this creation by fire, removing sin and corruption, renewing rather than replacing.

**Evidence for renewal:**

- **Romans 8:21:** "The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption"—set free, not destroyed.
- **Colossians 1:20:** God reconciles "to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven"—reconciliation implies continuity.
- **Revelation 21:5:** "I am making all things *new*" (kainos—renewed quality) rather than "I am making *all new* things."
- **Jesus's resurrection body:** Continuity with transformation. Same body, glorified. Creation follows the same pattern.

The fire that "burns up" may purify rather than annihilate—like refining gold, not destroying it.

## The Hebrew Vision: Eden Restored

Biblical eschatology echoes Genesis:

**Eden:**
- God walks with humanity (Genesis 3:8)
- Tree of life available (Genesis 2:9)
- No curse (Genesis 2-3)
- River flows from God's presence (Genesis 2:10)

**New Jerusalem:**
- God dwells with humanity (Revelation 21:3)
- Tree of life restored (Revelation 22:2)
- "No longer any curse" (Revelation 22:3)
- River of life flows from throne (Revelation 22:1)

**The end recapitulates the beginning—and surpasses it.** What was lost in Eden is restored in new creation, but glorified, secure, permanent.

## The New Jerusalem

Revelation 21:2: "I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."

**Coming down:** Heaven comes to earth. Not humanity escaping to heaven, but God coming to dwell with humanity.

**Revelation 21:3:** "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God."

**The goal of redemption:** Not humans going to God's place, but God making His home with humans. Emmanuel—God with us—consummated.

## Physical, Not Merely Spiritual

**Revelation 21:24-26:** "By [the city's] light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it... They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations."

**Nations bringing glory:** Suggests continuity of human culture, purified and offered to God. The good of human civilization isn't erased but redeemed.

**Isaiah 60:5-6:** "The wealth of the nations shall come to you... They shall bring gold and frankincense."

**Feasting:**
- Isaiah 25:6: "On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wine."
- Revelation 19:9: "Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb."

Eating and drinking in new creation. Physical bodies in physical world.

## What Won't Be There

**Revelation 21:4:** "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."

**Gone forever:**
- Death
- Mourning
- Crying
- Pain
- The curse (Revelation 22:3)
- Night (Revelation 22:5)
- The sea (Revelation 21:1—symbol of chaos/danger in ancient thought)

Everything that made this creation groan is removed.

## What Will Be There

**God's presence:** Direct, unmediated. "They will see his face" (Revelation 22:4).

**Resurrection bodies:** We will be embodied, physical, real.

**Work and purpose:** "His servants will worship him" (Revelation 22:3). Not idle but engaged—meaningful activity without futility.

**Relationships:** Nations, peoples—human community perfected.

**The tree of life:** "For the healing of the nations" (Revelation 22:2). Full flourishing.

## Greek vs. Hebrew Eschatology

**Greek (Platonic) tendency:**
- Material world is inferior
- Souls escape to spiritual realm
- Heaven is immaterial, ethereal
- Bodies are left behind
- Eternal "spiritual" existence

**Hebrew vision:**
- Material world is good (Genesis 1:31)
- Creation groans for redemption, not destruction (Romans 8:19-22)
- Heaven comes to earth
- Bodies are resurrected
- Eternal *embodied* existence in renewed creation

**The Bible is Hebrew, not Greek.** The hope is not escape from creation but its healing.

## Implications for Now

**1. Creation care matters**

If God will renew creation, we should value it now. Stewardship, not exploitation.

**2. Culture-making matters**

If nations bring their glory into new creation, human creativity has eternal significance. Art, science, building—all can honor God.

**3. Justice matters**

New creation is where "righteousness dwells" (2 Peter 3:13). Working for justice now aligns with God's ultimate purpose.

**4. The body matters**

Resurrection bodies in new creation mean bodies matter now. How we treat bodies—our own and others'—has eternal significance.

**5. Hope is concrete**

Christian hope isn't vague "going to a better place." It's specific: bodily resurrection, renewed earth, God dwelling with us. Real life—better than we can imagine.

## The Promise

"Behold, I am making all things new" (Revelation 21:5).

Not escaping creation. Not destroying it. Making it new.

The groaning will end. The tears will be wiped away. The curse will be lifted. God will dwell with His people in a world finally made right.

This is the hope. This is the end of the story. This is where history is headed.

"Come, Lord Jesus" (Revelation 22:20).
