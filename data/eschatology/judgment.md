**The Judge:** Jesus Christ, appointed by the Father.

# Final Judgment: The Great Assize

"It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment" (Hebrews 9:27).

Judgment is not speculation but certainty. How do we understand it?

## The Certainty of Judgment

**Acts 17:31:** "He has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."

**Romans 14:10:** "We will all stand before the judgment seat of God."

**2 Corinthians 5:10:** "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil."

**Revelation 20:12:** "I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened."

Judgment is not optional, not escapable, not negotiable. All humanity faces accounting.

## The Judge: Jesus Christ

**John 5:22:** "The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son."

**Acts 10:42:** Jesus is "the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead."

**2 Timothy 4:1:** "Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead."

The one who died for sinners will judge sinners. The one who offered mercy will render verdict.

## The Basis of Judgment

What determines the verdict?

### Works

**Matthew 16:27:** "The Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done."

**Romans 2:6:** "He will render to each one according to his works."

**Revelation 20:12:** "The dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done."

Scripture repeatedly says judgment is according to works.

### Faith

**John 3:18:** "Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already."

**John 5:24:** "Whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life."

**Romans 8:1:** "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."

Faith in Christ determines destiny.

### Resolution: Faith Working Through Love

**Galatians 5:6:** "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love."

**James 2:17:** "Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."

Faith that saves produces works. Works that save flow from faith. Judgment by works reveals the reality of faith.

**For believers:** Works don't earn salvation but evidence it. The judgment seat of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:10) evaluates faithfulness for reward, not salvation.

**For unbelievers:** Works reveal hearts. Those who reject Christ show it in how they lived.

## Different Judgments?

Some theologians distinguish:

**1. Judgment seat of Christ (Bema)**
- For believers only
- Evaluates faithful service
- Determines rewards, not salvation
- 1 Corinthians 3:12-15: Works tested by fire; some burned up but person saved

**2. Great White Throne (Revelation 20:11-15)**
- For unbelievers
- The final judgment
- Results in second death (lake of fire)

**3. Judgment of nations (Matthew 25:31-46)**
- Sheep and goats separated
- Based on treatment of "the least of these"
- Some see this as distinct; others as same as final judgment

Whether these are separate events or different aspects of one judgment is debated.

## The Books

Revelation 20:12: "Books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life."

**The books:** Record of deeds—what each person has done.

**The book of life:** Those whose names are written receive eternal life (Revelation 20:15).

**Revelation 20:15:** "If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."

Destiny determined by the book of life; judgment rendered according to works.

## The Outcome

### Eternal Life

**Matthew 25:46:** "And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."

**John 3:16:** "Whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

Life in God's presence, in resurrection bodies, in new creation—forever.

### Eternal Punishment

**Matthew 25:41:** "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."

**Revelation 20:15:** "If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."

The nature of this punishment is [debated](#eschatology/punishment 'Greek')—eternal conscious torment or annihilation? But its reality is biblical.

## Greek vs. Hebrew Perspectives

**Greek approach:**
- Systematic categorization of judgments
- Precise definition of criteria
- Logical consistency between faith and works

**Hebrew approach:**
- Covenant faithfulness vindicated
- Day of the Lord—God acting to set things right
- Corporate and cosmic dimension (nations judged, creation renewed)
- Less concerned with mechanism, more with justice finally done

**The Bible contains both:**
- Systematic accounts (Revelation 20)
- Prophetic imagery (sheep/goats, fire, books)
- Promises of vindication (Psalms, prophets)

## The Purpose of Judgment Doctrine

**1. Accountability**
We're not autonomous. Our lives matter. Choices have consequences. God sees and will respond.

**2. Comfort**
Injustices will be addressed. Oppressors will answer. Victims will be vindicated. "Vengeance is mine, I will repay" (Romans 12:19).

**3. Urgency**
If judgment is coming, the gospel must go forth. "Knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others" (2 Corinthians 5:11).

**4. Assurance**
For those in Christ: "No condemnation" (Romans 8:1). We face assessment, not condemnation.

## The Gospel and Judgment

The gospel is not: "There is no judgment."

The gospel is: "Judgment is real, but Christ bore it for you."

"God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God" (Romans 5:8-9).

Judgment is coming. But for those in Christ, the verdict is already in: justified, forgiven, accepted.

This is not license to sin (Romans 6:1-2) but freedom to live without fear, knowing the Judge is also our Savior.
