What happens at the end?

**Greek systematic approach:** Systematic timelines, dispensational charts, categorical distinctions (rapture, tribulation, millennium, judgment, eternal states).

**Hebrew apocalyptic approach:** Resistance literature, covenant vindication, Day of the Lord, new creation as Eden restored.

Both ask: How does God's story end? Greek systematizes the timeline; Hebrew tells the story.

# End Times: What Happens at the End?

Theologians call this *eschatology* (from Greek *eschatos*, "last" + *logos*, "study")—the doctrine of last things, final judgment, and eternal destiny.

## The Biblical Narrative Arc

Scripture tells a story with a beginning, middle, and end:

**Creation** - God makes a good world, places humans in Eden
**Fall** - Sin enters, death reigns, creation groans
**Redemption** - God acts through Israel, culminating in Christ
**Consummation** - God finishes the work, makes all things new

End times theology is about the consummation—how does God's story end?

## Greek Systematic Approach

Western theology tends to systematize end times into:

**Individual end times:**
- [Death](#eschatology/death 'Drill') and the intermediate state
- Heaven and hell as destinations

**Cosmic end times:**
- Christ's return (Second Coming)
- [Resurrection](#eschatology/resurrection 'Drill') of the dead
- Final [judgment](#eschatology/judgment 'Drill')
- [New creation](#eschatology/new-creation 'Drill') and eternal states

**Millennial views:**
- Premillennialism, postmillennialism, amillennialism
- Pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation, post-tribulation rapture
- Dispensational charts and timelines

**Strength:** Organizes complex biblical data into coherent systems.
**Weakness:** May impose grids on texts that resist systematization.

## Hebrew Apocalyptic Approach

Hebrew/Jewish end times thinking emerges from apocalyptic literature—Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Revelation.

**Key features:**

**Resistance literature:** Written under oppression (Babylon, Persia, Rome), promising God's vindication of His suffering people.

**Day of the Lord:** Not a single event but a recurring pattern—God's intervention to judge evil and deliver His people. Partial fulfillments point to ultimate fulfillment.

**Two ages:** *Olam hazeh* (this age) and *olam haba* (the age to come). The Messiah inaugurates the new age; it overlaps with the old until consummation.

**Corporate focus:** End times is about Israel's vindication, the nations' judgment, creation's restoration—not primarily individual souls going to heaven.

**New creation:** Not escape from the material world, but its redemption. "Behold, I am making all things new" (Revelation 21:5)—not "all new things."

## The Tension

**Greek:** When and how do the events occur? Systematize the timeline.

**Hebrew:** What is God doing? Tell the story of vindication and restoration.

**Greek concern:** Get the sequence right (rapture before or after tribulation?).

**Hebrew concern:** Trust the God who keeps His promises.

Both matter. The biblical texts contain timelines (Daniel's weeks, Revelation's sequences). But the purpose isn't satisfying curiosity—it's sustaining hope.

## Core Topics

**[Death and Intermediate State](#eschatology/death 'Drill'):** What happens when we die? Where are the dead before resurrection?

**[Resurrection](#eschatology/resurrection 'Drill'):** Bodily resurrection of all humanity. Why it matters, what kind of bodies.

**[Judgment](#eschatology/judgment 'Drill'):** Final accounting. Basis of judgment, the [eternal punishment](#eschatology/punishment 'Greek') debate.

**[New Creation](#eschatology/new-creation 'Drill'):** New heavens and new earth. Not escape from creation, but its restoration.

## Millennial Views

Three major positions on Revelation 20's "thousand years":

**Premillennialism:** Christ returns *before* the millennium. Establishes literal earthly kingdom for 1,000 years, then final judgment.

**Postmillennialism:** Christ returns *after* the millennium. Gospel gradually transforms the world; Christ returns to a Christianized earth.

**Amillennialism:** The millennium is symbolic of the church age. No literal 1,000-year earthly reign; Christ's kingdom is spiritual/present.

All three are held by orthodox Christians. The debates are about interpretation, not orthodoxy.

## The Heart of End Times

Ultimately, end times theology answers: **Does God win?**

The resounding biblical answer: Yes.

"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away" (Revelation 21:4).

Not speculation about timelines, but confidence in God's faithfulness to complete what He started.
