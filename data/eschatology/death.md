What happens when we die?

**Greek view:** The immortal soul departs the mortal body. Soul goes to heaven (or hell) immediately. Body waits for resurrection.

**Hebrew view:** Death is the end of the whole person. The dead await resurrection in Sheol—realm of the dead, shadowy existence.

**New Testament:** "Away from the body, at home with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:8). But also: resurrection is essential, not optional.

# Death: Enemy and Gateway

Death is the last enemy (1 Corinthians 15:26). It entered through sin (Romans 5:12). Yet for believers, death leads to being "with Christ" (Philippians 1:23).

## The Reality of Death

**Physical death:** Separation of breath/life from body. The body returns to dust.

**Spiritual death:** Separation from God, the source of life. This is the deeper death behind physical death.

**Genesis 2:17:** "In the day that you eat of it you shall surely die." Adam didn't die physically that day—but he died spiritually, cut off from the tree of life.

## Greek View: Soul Departs Body

**The framework:**
- Humans are souls inhabiting bodies
- At death, the soul exits the body
- Soul continues in conscious existence (heaven or hell)
- Body decays; awaits resurrection to rejoin soul

**Biblical support:**
- "The spirit returns to God who gave it" (Ecclesiastes 12:7)
- "Away from the body and at home with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:8)
- "Today you will be with me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43)
- Rich man and Lazarus in conscious post-death states (Luke 16:19-31)

**Implication:** The intermediate state is conscious existence. Believers are "with Christ" immediately. Unbelievers face judgment.

## Hebrew View: Whole Person Dies

**The framework:**
- Humans are unified beings, not souls in bodies
- Death ends the whole person
- The dead go to *Sheol*—realm of the dead
- Resurrection is not soul-body reunion but re-creation of the whole person

**Sheol in the Old Testament:**
- Not heaven or hell, but the grave, the pit
- All the dead go there—righteous and wicked
- Shadowy, diminished existence (Ecclesiastes 9:5: "the dead know nothing")
- Separated from God's active presence (Psalm 6:5: "in Sheol who will give you praise?")

**Biblical support:**
- Job 14:12: The dead "will not awake or be roused out of their sleep" until heavens are no more
- Psalm 115:17: "The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence"
- Daniel 12:2: "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake"—death as sleep

**Implication:** Hope is in resurrection, not immortality of the soul. Without resurrection, the dead are truly dead.

## The Intermediate State Problem

If death ends the whole person, what about being "with Christ" at death?

**Option 1: Soul-sleep**

The dead are unconscious until resurrection. "Sleep" language (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14) is literal. From the dead person's subjective perspective, death and resurrection are immediate (no experienced gap).

**Held by:** Some Reformers, Seventh-day Adventists, some evangelicals.

**Problem:** What about the rich man and Lazarus? "Today you will be with me in Paradise"?

**Option 2: Conscious but incomplete**

The dead are conscious but in an incomplete state—not fully alive. They await resurrection to be whole persons again.

**Held by:** Most evangelical theology.

**This view:** Death is abnormal. Being "unclothed" (2 Corinthians 5:4) is not the soul's natural state but a temporary condition. Resurrection cloths us with immortal bodies.

**Option 3: Time doesn't apply**

From God's perspective (and perhaps the dead person's), time between death and resurrection doesn't exist the way we experience it. The dead enter eternity; resurrection is "immediate" from their perspective.

**Held by:** Some theologians who emphasize eternity's timelessness.

## Death of Christ

Jesus's death shows what death is:

**Real death:** Jesus truly died. Not just His body—He committed His spirit to the Father (Luke 23:46). The whole person of Jesus entered death.

**Descent:** "He descended into hell" (Apostles' Creed) or to Hades/Sheol (1 Peter 3:19). He entered the realm of the dead.

**Victory:** Death could not hold Him (Acts 2:24). He rose bodily, demonstrating that death is conquered.

**For us:** "Because I live, you also will live" (John 14:19). His resurrection guarantees ours.

## Pastoral Implications

**For the grieving:**
We grieve, but "not as others do who have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Our dead are "with Christ"—and will be raised when He returns.

**For the dying:**
"To live is Christ, to die is gain" (Philippians 1:21). Death is not annihilation but transition—difficult, enemy, but not final.

**For the living:**
Death's sting is removed (1 Corinthians 15:55-56). We need not fear death because Jesus has passed through it ahead of us.

## The Hope

The intermediate state is intermediate—temporary. The hope is not "going to heaven when you die" (though believers are with Christ) but resurrection: embodied life in the new creation.

"We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet" (1 Corinthians 15:51-52).

Death is real. Death is enemy. But death is defeated. And resurrection is coming.
