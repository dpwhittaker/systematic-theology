title: Assembly

[The Church](#church/church 'Parent')
---
The church is *ekklesia*—the called-out ones. Not a building, not an [institution](#church/institution 'Greek'), but a *gathering*.

The Greek word *ekklesia* translates the Hebrew *qahal*: the assembly of Israel before YHWH. When God calls, the people assemble. When the trumpet sounds, they gather. The church is not an organization you join—it is a summons you answer.

At [Sinai](#god/covenants 'Hebrew'), God assembled the *qahal* and spoke His covenant. In the wilderness, Moses convened the assembly before the Tent of Meeting. In Jerusalem, the people gathered at the Temple for the appointed feasts. The church continues this pattern: God calls, we assemble, He speaks, we respond.

The New Testament uses *ekklesia* over 100 times—never for a building, always for people. "Where two or three are gathered in My name, there I am among them" (Matt 18:20). The church exists in the gathering, not in the structure. Disperse the assembly, and the church goes with them—into homes, marketplaces, prisons.

This is profoundly Hebrew: God known through *presence*, not definition. The [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') of Christ assembled, not organized. A living organism responding to its Head, not an institution preserving its traditions.

Contrast this with the Greek instinct: define the essence, establish the structure, codify the [authority](#church/authority 'Greek'). But the Hebrew approach resists this. The church is an event—the gathering of God's people in response to His call. You cannot capture it in organizational charts.

The [covenant community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew') assembled before God—this is the church.

# Biblical Foundation

The Hebrew *qahal* appears throughout the Old Testament:
- "The assembly (*qahal*) of the LORD" (Deut 23:1-8)—who may enter God's gathered people
- "On the day of the assembly (*qahal*)" (Deut 9:10, 10:4, 18:16)—Sinai, when Israel was constituted as God's people
- "All the assembly (*qahal*) said 'Amen!'" (Neh 5:13)—corporate response to covenant renewal

The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) translated *qahal* as *ekklesia*—the same word Jesus uses: "I will build My *ekklesia*" (Matt 16:18). Not a new thing, but the continuation of God's assembled people.

## The Assembly Gathers

In Acts, the church assembles constantly:
- "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers" (Acts 2:42)
- "When they were released, they went to their friends and reported... And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God" (Acts 4:23-24)
- "On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them" (Acts 20:7)

The assembly is not incidental to church life—it *is* church life. Hebrews warns: "Not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another" (Heb 10:25). The church exists in the gathering.

## Assembly and Israel

The church's continuity with [Israel](#church/israel 'Drill') is not primarily theological—it is *terminological*. The same word (*qahal/ekklesia*) describes both. Peter makes this explicit: "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession" (1 Pet 2:9)—applying Exodus 19:5-6 (Israel at Sinai) directly to the church.

Paul uses corporate metaphors constantly: "The Israel of God" (Gal 6:16), "Abraham's offspring" (Gal 3:29), "fellow citizens with the saints" (Eph 2:19), "grafted in" (Rom 11:17-24). The church is the continuation of God's assembled people—now including Gentiles by grace through faith.

The question is not *whether* the church is the assembly, but *who* constitutes the assembly. Israel: physical descent from Abraham. Church: spiritual descent through faith in Christ. But the structure remains: God calls, the people assemble, covenant is enacted.

## Implications

If the church is fundamentally an *assembly*, several things follow:

1. **Presence over structure**: The church exists where God's people gather in His name, not where institutional forms are maintained.

2. **Event over entity**: The church happens when we assemble, not as a permanent organization between gatherings.

3. **Response over membership**: You belong to the assembly by answering God's call, not by joining an organization.

4. **Corporate over individual**: The assembly is inherently plural—you cannot be the *ekklesia* alone. Individualism misses the point.

This is not to deny structure entirely—every assembly needs some order (1 Cor 14:40). But the Hebrew framework prioritizes *gathering* over *governing*, *presence* over *hierarchy*, *response* over *membership*.

The church is the people God summons. When we assemble, there He is.
