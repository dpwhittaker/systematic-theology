title: Authority
---
[The Church](#church/church 'Parent')
---
Who has *authority* in the church? Who decides doctrine, disciplines members, ordains leaders, interprets Scripture?

This is the Greek question: Define the structure, establish the chain of command, codify the procedures. Authority flows from top to bottom—God to Christ to apostles to bishops to priests to people. Clear hierarchy prevents chaos.

But the New Testament is surprisingly ambiguous:
- Jesus: "You are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers... Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matt 23:8-11)
- Paul: Elders, overseers, deacons—but their authority is moral (character), not positional (office)
- Peter: "Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock" (1 Pet 5:2-3)

The Hebrew approach resists hierarchical authority. The [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') gathers under God's authority, not human mediators. The [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') responds to its Head, not to institutional bureaucracy. The [covenant community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew') is mutual—bearing one another's burdens, submitting to one another in love.

Is authority *vertical* (top-down hierarchy) or *mutual* (Spirit-gifted, character-based, servant leadership)?

# Three Models of Church Authority

## 1. Episcopal: Authority Vested in Bishops

**Structure**: Hierarchical—bishops over priests over deacons over laity. The bishop is the visible center of unity for each diocese.

**Rationale**:
- Apostolic succession: Bishops trace their authority through unbroken lineage to the apostles
- Unity: One bishop per city prevents division (Ignatius of Antioch)
- Order: Clear chain of command preserves doctrine and disciplines heresy

**Variations**:
- **Catholic**: Pope (Bishop of Rome) has universal jurisdiction; bishops in communion with Rome
- **Orthodox**: Bishops are equal (*primus inter pares*—first among equals); patriarchs have honorary primacy
- **Anglican**: Bishops retain apostolic succession but reject papal supremacy

**Strengths**:
- Historical continuity with early church structures
- Clear authority for settling disputes
- Visible unity under episcopal oversight

**Weaknesses**:
- Concentrates power in few hands, risking abuse
- Creates clergy/laity distinction foreign to New Testament "priesthood of all believers" (1 Pet 2:9)
- Appeals to apostolic succession, but no explicit biblical command for this structure

**Biblical Warrant**:
- Acts 20:28: Paul addresses "overseers" (*episkopoi*) at Ephesus
- 1 Tim 3:1-7, Titus 1:7-9: Qualifications for overseers
- Early church tradition (Ignatius, Irenaeus, Cyprian) assumes episcopal authority

**Critique**:
- New Testament uses "overseer" (*episkopos*) and "elder" (*presbyteros*) interchangeably (Acts 20:17, 28; Titus 1:5, 7)
- No evidence of single-bishop rule in first century; plurality of elders is the norm
- Jesus explicitly rejects hierarchical structures: "It shall not be so among you" (Matt 20:26)

## 2. Presbyterian: Authority Vested in Elders

**Structure**: Representative—elders govern collectively (presbyteries, synods, general assembly). No single bishop over a region; councils of elders make decisions.

**Rationale**:
- Plurality of elders in every New Testament church (Acts 14:23, Titus 1:5, James 5:14)
- Collective wisdom prevents tyranny of one man
- Distinction between teaching elders (pastors) and ruling elders (governance)

**Variations**:
- **Reformed/Presbyterian**: Graded courts—session (local), presbytery (regional), synod/general assembly (national)
- **Some Evangelical**: Elder-led, but without formal denominational structure

**Strengths**:
- Biblically supported: Elders appointed in every church (Acts 14:23)
- Checks and balances: No single authority, but collective discernment
- Includes laity in governance (ruling elders are not clergy)

**Weaknesses**:
- Can become bureaucratic—decisions by committee slow and cautious
- Still creates a ruling class, just corporate instead of individual
- Disputes between presbyteries can deadlock, causing division

**Biblical Warrant**:
- Acts 15: Jerusalem Council—apostles and elders deliberate together
- Acts 20:17: Paul summons "elders" (plural) from Ephesus
- 1 Tim 5:17: "Elders who rule well" implies governing authority

**Critique**:
- Elders' authority in the New Testament is moral (character, maturity), not legislative (making laws)
- The New Testament never describes presbytery meetings, synods, or voting procedures
- Congregational involvement is assumed (Acts 6:3-5, 15:22), not delegated to representatives

## 3. Congregational: Authority Vested in the Gathered Church

**Structure**: Local autonomy—each congregation governs itself. No hierarchy beyond the local church. Members vote on doctrine, leadership, discipline.

**Rationale**:
- Every believer is a priest (1 Pet 2:9); no mediators between God and the congregation
- The Spirit is given to all believers, not just leaders (Acts 2:17-18)
- Major decisions involve "the whole church" (Acts 6:2-5, 15:22)

**Variations**:
- **Baptist**: Local church autonomy, congregational vote on all matters
- **Anabaptist/Mennonite**: Radical egalitarianism, mutual submission
- **Brethren/Plymouth**: No formal clergy; rotating leadership, Spirit-led meetings

**Strengths**:
- Most consistent with New Testament priesthood of all believers
- Prevents clerical tyranny—no one person or group controls the church
- Maximizes member participation and responsibility

**Weaknesses**:
- Vulnerable to majority rule overriding biblical truth ("everyone did what was right in his own eyes," Judg 21:25)
- Lack of oversight beyond the local church risks doctrinal drift or abuse
- Can be chaotic; strong personalities dominate "leaderless" structures

**Biblical Warrant**:
- Acts 6:2-5: The apostles say, "Pick out from among you seven men"—congregation selects deacons
- Acts 15:22: Decision at Jerusalem Council made "with the whole church"
- Matt 18:17: Discipline involves "tell it to the church"—corporate, not just leaders

**Critique**:
- Elders/overseers clearly have governing authority (Heb 13:17, "Obey your leaders")
- Congregations are often immature, factious, or doctrinally unstable (1 Cor 3:1-3)
- The New Testament shows apostolic authority *over* churches (Paul's letters), not just equality

# Historical Development of Authority Structures

## Early Church (AD 30-150): Fluidity
- Apostles have natural authority as eyewitnesses
- Elders appointed in each church (Acts 14:23)
- No uniform structure: "Overseers" and "elders" used interchangeably
- Gradual emergence of single bishop by early second century (Ignatius)

## Post-Constantinian Church (AD 313-1500): Hierarchical Centralization
- Bishops gain civil authority under Christian emperors
- Rome claims primacy based on Peter's succession (Matt 16:18)
- Councils (Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon) enforce orthodoxy through bishops
- Clergy/laity divide solidifies; sacraments require priestly mediation

## Reformation (AD 1517-1700): Authority Questioned
- Luther: Priesthood of all believers; Scripture alone (*sola Scriptura*) over church tradition
- Calvin: Elders govern, but Scripture is ultimate authority
- Radical Reformers (Anabaptists): Reject all hierarchy; Spirit-led congregations
- Result: Fragmentation—each Protestant group claims biblical authority, but different structures

## Modern Era (AD 1700-present): Multiplication of Models
- Denominations proliferate, each with different authority structures
- Charismatic/Pentecostal: Spirit's direct authority through prophecy, tongues, signs
- Non-denominational: Pragmatic structures; "what works" rather than "what's biblical"
- Mega-churches: CEO model—senior pastor as visionary leader

# Greek Philosophy and Authority

The institutional model of authority reflects Greek philosophical assumptions:

## Hierarchy as Natural Order
Aristotle: The cosmos is hierarchical—God (Unmoved Mover) at the top, descending through celestial spheres to earthly elements. Society mirrors this: king over citizens, master over slaves, men over women. The church naturally follows: Pope/Patriarch over bishops over priests over laity.

## Mediation as Necessity
Plato: The many cannot access the Forms directly; they need philosophers to mediate truth. Similarly, the laity cannot access God directly; they need priests to mediate sacraments, bishops to mediate authority, the church to mediate salvation.

## Truth as Transmitted by Authority
Knowledge flows from the top down. The apostles received revelation from Christ; bishops received authority from apostles; the faithful receive teaching from bishops. Authority guarantees truth. Reject authority, and you lose access to truth.

# Hebrew Alternative: Mutual Submission

The Hebrew approach resists top-down hierarchy:

## God Alone is King
Israel resisted human kingship: "The LORD is our judge; the LORD is our lawgiver; the LORD is our king; He will save us" (Isa 33:22). When Israel demanded a king like other nations, God said, "They have rejected Me from being king over them" (1 Sam 8:7).

The [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') gathers before God, not before a human ruler. The church needs servants, not masters.

## Leaders as Servants
Jesus: "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves" (Luke 22:25-26).

Authority in the church is *functional* (serving), not *positional* (ruling). Elders shepherd, they do not dominate. Teachers equip, they do not control.

## The Spirit Distributes Gifts
"All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as He wills" (1 Cor 12:11).

Authority comes from *function*, not *office*. If the Spirit gifts you to teach, you teach. If the Spirit gifts you to serve, you serve. If the Spirit gifts you to lead, you lead. But all are equal before God; all are priests.

## Mutual Submission
"Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Eph 5:21).

Not: Leaders rule, laity obey.
But: Everyone submits to everyone in love.

"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ" (Gal 6:2). Authority is reciprocal, not hierarchical. You correct me, I correct you. You teach me, I teach you. Together we discern the Spirit's leading.

# Tension and Synthesis

Can both be true? Can the church have structure without hierarchy, authority without domination, order without control?

Perhaps the answer is *charismatic leadership*: Authority flows from Spirit-gifted function, not institutional office.

- Elders/overseers exist, but they *serve* the body, not rule it
- The congregation discerns the Spirit together, not passively receives from leaders
- Discipline is corporate (Matt 18:17, "tell it to the church"), not merely hierarchical (bishops judging)
- Unity comes from the Spirit's presence, not institutional conformity

The danger of the Greek model: Authority becomes self-serving, preserving [institution](#church/institution 'Greek') over serving the [mission](#church/mission 'Drill').

The danger of the Hebrew model: Without structure, strong personalities dominate or chaos reigns.

The solution is not a fixed structure, but a living balance: Leaders lead, but as servants. The congregation submits, but as priests. Authority exists, but as gift of the Spirit, not grasp for power.

"Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you" (Heb 13:17).

Leaders have authority—but they will "give an account." They are not autonomous; they are accountable. To God, to the congregation, to one another.

The church is the [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') of Christ. The Head alone has absolute authority. All human authority is derivative, temporary, and servant-shaped.
