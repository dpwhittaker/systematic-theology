title: Church and Israel

[The Church](#church/church 'Parent')
---
What is the church's relationship to Israel? Does the church *replace* Israel, *continue* Israel, or exist *alongside* Israel?

This is one of the most contested questions in theology—and one with horrific historical consequences. Replacement theology (*supersessionism*) fueled centuries of anti-Semitism, pogroms, and ultimately contributed to the ideological climate that allowed the Holocaust.

Three main views:
- **Replacement Theology**: The church replaces Israel; God is done with ethnic Jews
- **Two-Covenant Theology**: Israel and the church are separate peoples with separate covenants
- **Fulfillment/Continuity**: The church is the continuation of Israel, now expanded to include Gentiles

The stakes are high: How we answer shapes our reading of Scripture, our view of God's faithfulness, and our relationship with Jewish people today.

The Greek approach: Define the church's essence, then determine Israel's status.
The Hebrew approach: Trace the narrative—Abraham, Sinai, Exile, Return, Messiah—and see the church as part of Israel's story, not its replacement.

# The Biblical Tension

The New Testament makes paradoxical claims about Israel and the church:

## Continuity Language

Paul uses Israel-language for the church:
- "You are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise" (Gal 3:29)
- "The Israel of God" (Gal 6:16)
- "A chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation" (1 Pet 2:9—quoting Ex 19:5-6)
- "We are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God" (Phil 3:3)

Jesus applies Israel's identity to His followers:
- "I am the vine, you are the branches" (John 15:5—Israel is the vine in Isa 5:1-7, Jer 2:21)
- "Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" (Luke 12:32—Israel is God's flock in Ezek 34)

The church inherits Israel's calling, Israel's covenant, Israel's promises.

## Discontinuity Language

But Paul also sharply distinguishes Israel and the church:
- "Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel" (Rom 9:6)
- "A Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit" (Rom 2:28-29)
- Ethnic Jews who reject Jesus are "branches broken off" (Rom 11:17)
- Gentile believers are "wild olive shoots, grafted in" (Rom 11:17)

Jesus confronts unbelieving Israel:
- "The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits" (Matt 21:43)
- "Your house is left to you desolate" (Matt 23:38)
- To Jews who reject Him: "You are of your father the devil" (John 8:44)

Rejection of Messiah has consequences. Israel's covenant blessings are not automatic.

## The Mystery: Romans 9-11

Paul wrestles with this tension in Romans 9-11—the most important passage on Israel and the church:

**Romans 9: God's Sovereign Choice**
- "Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel" (9:6)—ethnic descent does not guarantee covenant inclusion
- Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau—God chooses whom He will
- But Israel's unbelief is not arbitrary: "They have stumbled over the stumbling stone" (9:32)—they rejected Messiah

**Romans 10: Israel's Rejection of Messiah**
- "They have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge" (10:2)
- "They did not submit to God's righteousness" (10:3)—they sought righteousness by law, not by faith
- "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes" (10:4)—Jew and Gentile alike

**Romans 11: Israel's Future Hope**
- "God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew" (11:2)
- "A partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in" (11:25)—temporary, not permanent
- "And in this way all Israel will be saved" (11:26)—future restoration
- "As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable" (11:28-29)

Paul's conclusion: Israel's rejection of Messiah is real but temporary. God has not abandoned His covenant with Israel. Gentiles are grafted in, but the root remains: "It is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you" (11:18).

# Three Theological Models

## 1. Replacement Theology (Supersessionism)

**Claim**: The church replaces Israel as God's people. The old covenant is obsolete (Heb 8:13); the new covenant supersedes it. Ethnic Israel has no special status; God's promises now apply to the church.

**Rationale**:
- Israel rejected Messiah; judgment fell (AD 70 destruction of the Temple)
- "Your house is left to you desolate" (Matt 23:38)
- The church is the "new Israel," inheriting all covenant promises
- Ethnic distinction (Jew/Gentile) is abolished: "There is neither Jew nor Greek" (Gal 3:28)

**Scriptural Support**:
- Hebrews 8:13: "In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete"
- Matthew 21:43: "The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits"
- Galatians 3:7: "It is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham"

**Historical Consequences**:
- Church fathers (Justin Martyr, Chrysostom, Augustine) taught that Jews are cursed for rejecting Christ
- Medieval church enforced Jewish ghettos, forced conversions, pogroms
- Martin Luther's *On the Jews and Their Lies* (1543) advocated burning synagogues, confiscating property
- Replacement theology created theological climate that allowed the Holocaust—if Jews are cursed by God, who cares what happens to them?

**Critique**:
- Romans 11:1: "Has God rejected His people? By no means!"
- Romans 11:29: "The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable"
- Replacement theology ignores the olive tree metaphor: Gentiles are *grafted into* Israel's tree, not replacing it (Rom 11:17-24)
- It reads the church back into Old Testament promises instead of recognizing the church's dependence on Israel's covenant

## 2. Two-Covenant Theology

**Claim**: Israel and the church have separate covenants. Jews are saved through Torah faithfulness; Gentiles are saved through faith in Christ. God has two distinct peoples with two distinct paths to salvation.

**Rationale**:
- God's covenant with Israel is eternal (Gen 17:7, "everlasting covenant")
- Romans 11:29: "The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable"
- Jews do not need Jesus; they have the Mosaic covenant
- The church is God's plan for Gentiles, not Jews

**Scriptural Support**:
- Romans 9:4-5: Israel's covenant privileges remain—"the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises"
- Matthew 15:24: "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel"
- Acts 3:25: "You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant"

**Historical Motivation**:
- Post-Holocaust guilt: Christianity must repudiate anti-Semitism
- Jewish-Christian dialogue: Respect for Judaism requires affirming Torah as valid path

**Critique**:
- Contradicts the entire New Testament witness: "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12)
- Jesus to Jews: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me" (John 14:6)
- Paul (a Jew) says the law cannot justify: "By works of the law no one will be justified" (Gal 2:16)
- Two-covenant theology is well-intentioned but biblically indefensible

## 3. Fulfillment/Continuity Theology

**Claim**: The church is the continuation and expansion of Israel. Gentiles are *grafted into* Israel's covenant through faith in Israel's Messiah. Israel's calling remains, but now includes all nations.

**Rationale**:
- God's promise to Abraham: "In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed" (Gen 12:3)—always included Gentiles
- Jesus is the climax of Israel's story: "I have not come to abolish the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them" (Matt 5:17)
- The church does not replace Israel; the church is Israel *plus* Gentiles
- Ethnic Jews who believe in Jesus remain Israel; Gentiles who believe in Jesus are adopted into Israel

**Scriptural Support**:
- Romans 11:17-24: Olive tree metaphor—one tree, some branches broken off, new branches grafted in
- Galatians 3:29: "If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise"
- Ephesians 2:11-22: Gentiles were "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise" but are now "fellow citizens with the saints" through Christ

**Implications**:
- The church does not *replace* Israel; the church *is* Israel, now including Gentiles
- But ethnic Israel still has a future: "All Israel will be saved" (Rom 11:26)
- Jewish believers in Jesus do not cease to be Jews; Gentile believers do not become ethnically Jewish—but both are one in Christ (Eph 2:14-16)

**Tensions**:
- Does "all Israel will be saved" mean (1) all ethnic Jews eventually believe in Jesus, or (2) all true Israel (elect Jews and Gentiles) are saved?
- Is modern political Israel theologically significant, or is biblical Israel only the covenant people (church)?
- Should the church evangelize Jews, or respect Judaism as a valid covenant?

# The Olive Tree: Paul's Metaphor (Romans 11)

Paul's olive tree metaphor is critical:

## The Root: Abraham's Covenant
"If the root is holy, so are the branches" (11:16). The root is not the church—it is Abraham's covenant, Israel's calling. The church grows out of Israel's root.

## Natural Branches: Ethnic Israel
"Some of the branches were broken off" (11:17). Unbelieving Jews are broken off—not because they are Jewish, but because they rejected Messiah.

## Wild Branches: Gentile Believers
"You, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in" (11:17). Gentiles are not the tree; they are grafted into Israel's tree. They share the "rich root," but the root is not theirs.

## Warning to Gentiles
"Do not be arrogant toward the branches" (11:18). Gentile believers must not boast over Jews. "If God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you" (11:21). Gentiles can be broken off too.

## Hope for Israel
"If they do not continue in their unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again" (11:23). Israel's unbelief is not final. "All Israel will be saved" (11:26)—how and when is debated, but the promise stands.

# Historical Anti-Semitism and the Church

Replacement theology fueled horrific evil:

## Early Church Fathers
- **Justin Martyr** (~AD 160): *Dialogue with Trypho*—Jews are cursed for rejecting Christ
- **John Chrysostom** (~AD 387): *Adversus Judaeos*—"The synagogue is a brothel, a den of robbers, a lodging for wild beasts"
- **Augustine** (~AD 400): Jews should be preserved in degraded state as witnesses to Christian truth

## Medieval Church
- Forced conversions during Crusades
- Jews blamed for Black Death, forced into ghettos
- Spanish Inquisition, expulsions from England, France, Spain

## Reformation
- **Martin Luther** (1543): *On the Jews and Their Lies*—burn synagogues, destroy homes, confiscate Talmuds, ban rabbis from teaching
- Luther's anti-Semitic writings were used by the Nazis to justify persecution

## Modern Era
- Pogroms in Russia (1880s-1900s)
- Holocaust (1939-1945): 6 million Jews murdered
- Silence or complicity of many churches

## Post-Holocaust Repentance
- Vatican II (1965): *Nostra Aetate*—Jews are not cursed; anti-Semitism is condemned
- Many Protestant denominations have issued statements repudiating replacement theology and anti-Semitism

# Toward a Humble Ecclesiology

Whatever we believe about Israel, several principles are clear:

## 1. God's Covenant with Israel is Irrevocable
"The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable" (Rom 11:29). We cannot declare God finished with Israel.

## 2. The Church Depends on Israel's Covenant
"Salvation is from the Jews" (John 4:22). The church does not give Israel legitimacy; Israel's covenant gives the church existence. We are grafted in; we did not plant the tree.

## 3. Ethnic Israel is Not Automatically Saved
"Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel" (Rom 9:6). Ethnic descent does not save. Faith in Messiah is required—for Jews and Gentiles alike.

## 4. But God Has a Future Plan for Israel
"All Israel will be saved" (Rom 11:26). This remains a mystery, but the promise stands. We do not know the details, but we trust God's faithfulness.

## 5. Gentile Believers Must Not Be Arrogant
"Do not be arrogant toward the branches" (Rom 11:18). Replacement theology is arrogance: "We replaced them." The Hebrew framework is humility: "We were grafted into their covenant."

# Implications for Today

**Evangelism**: Should Christians evangelize Jews?
- Replacement theology says: Yes, aggressively—they are enemies of the gospel.
- Two-covenant theology says: No—they have their own covenant.
- Continuity theology says: Yes, lovingly—Jesus is Israel's Messiah, and we want all people (Jew and Gentile) to know Him. But coercion, manipulation, and triumphalism are ruled out.

**Political Israel**: Is modern Israel theologically significant?
- Some see the re-establishment of Israel (1948) as fulfillment of prophecy (Ezek 37, Amos 9:14-15).
- Others say biblical "Israel" is the people of God (church), not a political state.
- This remains disputed; humility is required.

**Jewish-Christian Dialogue**: Can we have mutual respect while maintaining different beliefs?
- Yes. We can love, honor, and learn from Jewish neighbors without pretending our theological differences don't exist.
- The church owes Jews repentance for centuries of anti-Semitism.
- But repentance does not require abandoning the gospel: Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, and we long for all people—Jew and Gentile—to know Him.

# The [Covenant Community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew') Includes Israel

The church is not separate from Israel. The church is the [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') of God's people—now including Gentiles by grace. The [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') of Christ is rooted in Israel's covenant.

This is the mystery Paul celebrates: "This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel" (Eph 3:6).

Not: Gentiles replace Israel.
Not: Gentiles have a separate covenant.
But: Gentiles are grafted into Israel's covenant, made fellow heirs through Jesus.

"For He Himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in His flesh the dividing wall of hostility... that He might create in Himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace" (Eph 2:14-15).

One new humanity in Christ—Jew and Gentile reconciled, not by abolishing distinction, but by uniting in Messiah.

The church does not supersede Israel. The church is Israel's story continuing, expanding to include all nations—just as God promised Abraham from the beginning.
