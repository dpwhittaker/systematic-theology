[The Church](#church/church 'Parent')
---
The church's *mission*: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matt 28:19-20).

This is the Great Commission—Jesus' final command before His ascension. But what does it mean? Is the mission primarily *evangelism* (saving souls), *discipleship* (forming Christ-likeness), or *transformation* (establishing God's kingdom on earth)?

**Greek approach**: Define the mission's essence. Categorize: Evangelism vs. social action. Prioritize: Word over deed, or integration?

**Hebrew approach**: The mission flows from covenant. God called Abraham to be a blessing to all nations (Gen 12:3). [Israel](#church/israel 'Drill') was to be "a light to the nations" (Isa 49:6). The church continues this calling—not as abstract task, but as covenant identity.

The [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') is sent. The [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') embodies Christ's presence in the world. The [covenant community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew') lives out God's kingdom, demonstrating His rule.

Is mission something the church *does*, or something the church *is*?

# The Great Commission: Five Versions

Jesus' final command appears in multiple forms across the Gospels and Acts:

## Matthew 28:18-20: Make Disciples
"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

**Emphasis**: Discipleship—not just converts, but followers who obey Jesus' commands.
**Scope**: "All nations" (*panta ta ethne*)—every ethnicity, not just Jews.
**Presence**: "I am with you always"—mission is empowered by Christ's presence.

## Mark 16:15-16: Preach the Gospel
"Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."

**Emphasis**: Proclamation—verbally declare the good news.
**Urgency**: Belief leads to salvation; unbelief leads to condemnation.
**Note**: Mark 16:9-20 is disputed—absent from earliest manuscripts. Some traditions consider it secondary.

## Luke 24:46-49: Repentance and Forgiveness
"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."

**Emphasis**: Repentance and forgiveness—the core gospel message.
**Starting Point**: Jerusalem first, then spreading outward (fulfilled in Acts).
**Empowerment**: Wait for the Spirit before beginning mission.

## John 20:21: Sent as Jesus Was Sent
"Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, even so I am sending you.'"

**Emphasis**: Identification—the church's mission mirrors Jesus' mission.
**Implication**: How was Jesus sent? In humility, service, suffering, love. The church is sent the same way.

## Acts 1:8: Witnesses to the Ends of the Earth
"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."

**Emphasis**: Witness—not persuasive argument, but testimony to what we have seen.
**Geographic Expansion**: Jerusalem → Judea → Samaria → ends of the earth (the structure of Acts).
**Spirit-Empowered**: Mission is impossible without the Spirit.

# Old Testament Background: Israel's Missionary Identity

The church's mission does not begin in Matthew 28. It begins with Abraham.

## Abraham: Blessing to All Nations
"I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing... and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed" (Gen 12:2-3).

Israel's election was never for Israel alone. God chose Abraham's descendants to mediate blessing to *all* nations. Israel's mission was to reveal God to the world.

## Exodus: Kingdom of Priests
"You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (Ex 19:6).

Priests mediate between God and humanity. Israel as a "kingdom of priests" was to represent God to the nations and represent the nations to God. The church inherits this priestly calling (1 Pet 2:9).

## Isaiah: Light to the Nations
"I will make you as a light for the nations, that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth" (Isa 49:6).

Israel was to display God's character—justice, mercy, faithfulness—so that nations would be drawn to YHWH. The Servant of the LORD (fulfilled in Jesus) brings salvation not just to Israel, but to the ends of the earth.

## Jonah: Reluctant Missionary
Jonah runs from God's command to preach repentance to Nineveh (Gentiles). God pursues him, forces him to go, and saves Nineveh. The message: God's compassion extends beyond Israel.

The problem: Israel failed the mission. Instead of being a light, they adopted the nations' idolatry (syncretism) or isolated themselves in ethnic pride (exclusivism). They were "a people laden with iniquity" (Isa 1:4).

## Jesus: True Israel
Jesus succeeds where Israel failed. He is the true Light (John 8:12), the true Vine (John 15:1), the true Israel. He perfectly reveals the Father (John 14:9), perfectly obeys the covenant, perfectly fulfills the mission.

The church is grafted into Jesus, the true Israel. The mission Jesus fulfills, He now entrusts to His [body](#church/body 'Hebrew'): "As the Father has sent Me, even so I am sending you" (John 20:21).

# Defining Mission: What Are We Sent to Do?

Three broad views:

## 1. Evangelism Focus: Save Souls
**Priority**: Proclaim the gospel, win converts, populate heaven.

**Rationale**:
- Eternity is at stake: "Whoever does not believe is condemned already" (John 3:18)
- The gospel is primarily about personal salvation: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31)
- Social action is secondary or distraction: "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?" (Mark 8:36)

**Strengths**:
- Takes the urgency of the gospel seriously
- Focuses on what only the church can do (no secular organization proclaims Christ)
- Aligns with Jesus' death for sin and call to repentance

**Weaknesses**:
- Can reduce the gospel to "soul insurance"—escape hell, go to heaven
- Ignores Jesus' ministry to the poor, sick, oppressed (Luke 4:18-19)
- Splits evangelism from discipleship, saving souls from transforming lives

## 2. Social Action Focus: Transform Society
**Priority**: Pursue justice, feed the hungry, liberate the oppressed, build God's kingdom on earth.

**Rationale**:
- Jesus came to "proclaim good news to the poor, liberty to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed" (Luke 4:18)
- Prophets condemned social injustice: "Let justice roll down like waters" (Amos 5:24)
- Faith without works is dead (James 2:26)—believing the gospel must produce justice

**Strengths**:
- Takes Jesus' earthly ministry seriously (healing, feeding, welcoming outcasts)
- Addresses systemic evil, not just individual sin
- Reflects God's heart for the poor and oppressed (Ps 146:7-9)

**Weaknesses**:
- Can reduce the gospel to social activism, losing the supernatural (resurrection, atonement, kingdom)
- Risks becoming indistinguishable from secular humanitarianism
- May neglect eternal realities in favor of temporal improvements

## 3. Holistic Mission: Word and Deed Integrated
**Priority**: Proclaim the gospel (word) *and* demonstrate God's love (deed). Evangelism and social action are inseparable.

**Rationale**:
- Jesus preached *and* healed (Matt 4:23)
- The gospel addresses the whole person—spiritual, physical, social, emotional
- The kingdom of God is both *present* (breaking in now through the church) and *future* (fully realized when Christ returns)

**Strengths**:
- Avoids false dichotomy between evangelism and social action
- Reflects Jesus' comprehensive ministry
- Recognizes that the gospel has implications for all of life, not just the afterlife

**Weaknesses**:
- Risk of losing focus—trying to do everything, excelling at nothing
- Can dilute the gospel's offense (cross, repentance, judgment) in favor of inoffensive service
- Requires discernment: When does helping become enabling? When does advocacy become compromise?

# Missional Theology: The Church Sent into the World

Recent missional theology reframes the question: Mission is not *what the church does*; mission is *what God is doing*, and the church joins Him.

## Missio Dei: God's Mission
The Trinity is inherently missional:
- The Father *sends* the Son (John 3:16)
- The Father and Son *send* the Spirit (John 14:26, 16:7)
- The Spirit *sends* the church (Acts 13:2-4)

Mission is God's activity, not ours. We are caught up in the Father's redemptive plan, sent as the Son was sent, empowered by the Spirit.

## Incarnational Mission: Sent into the World
"As the Father has sent Me, even so I am sending you" (John 20:21).

How was Jesus sent? He became incarnate—entered the world, took on flesh, dwelt among us (John 1:14). He did not remain distant; He became *one of us*.

Incarnational mission means:
- Enter the culture (contextualization, not isolation)
- Become part of the community (presence, not programs)
- Serve in humility (foot-washing, not power-grabbing)
- Suffer with and for others (cross-bearing, not triumphalism)

## Kingdom Mission: Already and Not Yet
Jesus proclaimed: "The kingdom of God is at hand" (Mark 1:15). The kingdom is *already* breaking in through Jesus' ministry, but *not yet* fully realized until His return.

The church's mission is to embody this in-between reality:
- Healing the sick (kingdom breaking in), but knowing not all will be healed (not yet)
- Pursuing justice (kingdom values), but knowing full justice awaits the final judgment (not yet)
- Forgiving enemies (kingdom ethic), but knowing evil will be ultimately defeated by Christ (not yet)

The church is a *sign*, *foretaste*, and *instrument* of the kingdom:
- **Sign**: Points to the kingdom—our unity, love, and holiness display God's rule
- **Foretaste**: Previews the kingdom—worship, reconciliation, justice give a glimpse of new creation
- **Instrument**: Advances the kingdom—through proclamation, service, and presence, God extends His reign

# The Spirit and Mission

Mission is impossible without the Spirit:

## Power for Witness
"You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be My witnesses" (Acts 1:8). Witness requires power—not human eloquence, but Spirit-anointing.

Peter before Pentecost: Denied Jesus three times (Matt 26:69-75).
Peter after Pentecost: Boldly proclaimed Jesus to thousands (Acts 2:14-41).

The difference: The Spirit.

## Conviction of Sin
"When He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment" (John 16:8). Evangelism is not persuasion technique—it is the Spirit's work to convict. We proclaim; the Spirit converts.

## Gifts for Ministry
"To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good" (1 Cor 12:7). Mission requires diverse gifts: teaching, healing, administration, mercy, prophecy, evangelism (Eph 4:11-12). The Spirit distributes these "as He wills" (1 Cor 12:11).

## Guidance for Strategy
The Spirit directs mission: "The Spirit said to Philip, 'Go over and join this chariot'" (Acts 8:29). "The Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" to enter Bithynia (Acts 16:7). Paul's vision of the Macedonian man (Acts 16:9-10).

Mission is not just executing a plan—it is following the Spirit's leading in real time.

# Challenges and Tensions

## Cultural Imperialism
Historic missions often conflated the gospel with Western culture—imposing European dress, architecture, music, and customs on converts. This is colonialism, not incarnation.

The gospel must be *translated* into every culture, not imposed *on* every culture. Paul: "To the Jews I became as a Jew... To those outside the law I became as one outside the law... I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some" (1 Cor 9:20-22).

## Persecution and Suffering
Jesus warned: "If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you" (John 15:20). Mission often leads to suffering, imprisonment, martyrdom.

The church must count the cost—not promise prosperity, but prepare for the cross. "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22).

## Syncretism vs. Contextualization
Contextualization (expressing the gospel in culturally appropriate forms) is necessary. But syncretism (blending the gospel with false beliefs) is apostasy.

Where is the line? This requires discernment, humility, and continual return to Scripture.

# The Church as Missional Community

Mission is not a program the church runs. Mission is the church's identity.

The [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') gathers for worship, scatters for mission.
The [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') is Christ's presence in the world—wherever we go, Christ goes through us.
The [covenant community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew') lives out God's kingdom, demonstrating His character to watching world.

Lesslie Newbigin: "The church is the hermeneutic of the gospel." The world reads the gospel by reading the church. If the church is divided, hypocritical, or compromised, the gospel is obscured. If the church embodies love, unity, and holiness, the gospel is visible.

"By this all people will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:35).

# Conclusion: Sent as Jesus Was Sent

The church's mission is clear: Proclaim the gospel, make disciples, baptize, teach, demonstrate God's love, pursue justice, embody the kingdom—empowered by the Spirit, following Christ's example, to the glory of the Father.

Not: Save souls and ignore bodies.
Not: Transform society and ignore eternity.
But: Proclaim and demonstrate the full gospel—"Jesus is Lord," and His lordship extends over every sphere of life.

The mission is not our idea. It is God's mission (*missio Dei*). We are privileged to participate in what the Father is doing, sent as the Son was sent, empowered by the Spirit.

"As the Father has sent Me, even so I am sending you" (John 20:21).
