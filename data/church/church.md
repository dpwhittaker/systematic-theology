The *community* of believers.

Key questions:
- *Nature* - Invisible spiritual body or visible institution?
- *Authority* - Who leads? Elders, bishops, or congregations?
- *Mission* - Worship, evangelism, or social transformation?
- *Sacraments* - How many? What do they do?
- *Unity* - One church or many denominations?
