The *community* of believers. Is the church an [institution](#church/institution 'Greek') or an [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew')? A hierarchical structure or the gathered [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') of Christ?

**Greek approach:** Define the church's essence and structure.
- [Institution](#church/institution 'Greek'): Hierarchy, offices, authority structures.
- [Marks](#church/marks 'Greek'): One, holy, catholic, apostolic—identifying the true church.
- [Authority](#church/authority 'Greek'): Who governs? Bishops, elders, or congregations?

**Hebrew approach:** Encounter the church as God's called-out people.
- [Assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew'): *Qahal* and *ekklesia*—the gathered congregation of God.
- [Body](#church/body 'Hebrew'): Corporate metaphor, not organization—living organism, bride of Christ.
- [Covenant Community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew'): The people of the new covenant in His blood.

**Tensions:**
- [Israel](#church/israel 'Drill'): Replacement theology or continuity? How do Gentiles join God's people?
- [Mission](#church/mission 'Drill'): Great Commission—discipling nations, baptizing, teaching.
- [Baptism](#baptism/baptism 'Drill'): Water and Spirit—immersion or sprinkling, infants or believers, sacrament or symbol?

Can both be true? The church as *organism* and *organization*?
