title: Marks of the Church
---
[The Church](#church/church 'Parent')
---
The *marks* of the church: one, holy, catholic, apostolic. These four adjectives from the Nicene Creed (AD 381) define the true church's essence.

This is the Greek approach: Identify the essential properties that distinguish the real from the counterfeit. Just as Aristotle defined "man" by genus and differentia, the church fathers defined the church by its essential marks.

But do these marks *describe* the church or *prescribe* it? Are they empirical observations or theological ideals? The visible church is divided, sinful, provincial, and often unfaithful. So what do the marks actually *mean*?

The Protestant Reformers added their own marks: the pure preaching of the Word, right administration of sacraments, (sometimes) church discipline. Each tradition claims *their* marks identify the true church—and excludes others.

The Hebrew approach asks: Can you capture the living [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') of God in a checklist? Does defining marks clarify truth, or create division?

# The Four Marks: Historical Development

The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (AD 381) declares: "We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church." These four marks became the standard test of ecclesial authenticity.

## One (*Una*)
"There is one body and one Spirit... one Lord, one faith, one baptism" (Eph 4:4-5).

**Original Meaning**: The church is united in Christ, not fragmented into sects. Paul rebukes divisions: "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?" (1 Cor 1:13). The church's unity reflects the Trinity's unity.

**Greek Philosophical Background**: *Henosis* (oneness) is a Platonic ideal. True being is unified; multiplicity indicates deficiency. The church participates in divine unity—"one" because God is one.

**Historical Reality**: By AD 381, the church was already fracturing—Donatists, Arians, schismatics. The creed asserted unity as *essential* even when empirically absent. The *real* church (invisible, ideal) is one, even if the *visible* church (empirical, actual) is divided.

**Implication**: Unity becomes a mark to *claim*, not achieve. Each faction declares itself the "one" true church and condemns others as schismatic.

## Holy (*Sancta*)
"Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify her... that she might be holy and without blemish" (Eph 5:25-27).

**Original Meaning**: The church is set apart for God, consecrated by Christ's sacrifice. "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation" (1 Pet 2:9). Holiness is not moral perfection, but *separation unto God*.

**Greek Philosophical Background**: *Hagios* (holy) in Hebrew thought means "set apart, dedicated." But Greek philosophy adds the idea of *purity*—freedom from contamination, stain, mixture. The church must be morally pure to be truly holy.

**Historical Reality**: The church has always included sinners. "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves" (1 John 1:8). Scandals, corruption, hypocrisy—the visible church is not empirically holy.

**Implication**: Holiness becomes *positional*, not *actual*. The church is holy *in Christ*, even if its members are unholy. Or: The *true* church (invisible believers) is holy, even if the *institutional* church (visible organization) is corrupt.

## Catholic (*Catholica*)
"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations" (Matt 28:19).

**Original Meaning**: *Katholikos* = "according to the whole" or "universal." The church is not limited to one ethnicity (Jews), one region (Palestine), or one culture (Greco-Roman). It is for *all* people in *all* places.

**Greek Philosophical Background**: Universalism is a Greek ideal. Philosophy seeks universal truths, not local customs. The church, as bearer of divine truth, must be universal—same faith, same structure, same authority everywhere.

**Historical Reality**: By AD 381, "catholic" also meant *orthodox*—the church that holds the apostolic faith against heresies. "Catholic" vs. "heretical" becomes the distinction. Later, "Catholic" becomes a proper name for the Roman church.

**Implication**: "Catholic" can mean (1) universal/worldwide, (2) orthodox/correct doctrine, or (3) Roman Catholic specifically. Each meaning excludes different groups.

## Apostolic (*Apostolica*)
"Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone" (Eph 2:20).

**Original Meaning**: The church is founded on apostolic testimony. The apostles were eyewitnesses of the resurrection (Acts 1:21-22), chosen by Christ, empowered by the Spirit. Their teaching is the church's foundation.

**Greek Philosophical Background**: Truth requires authoritative transmission. The apostles received revelation from Christ; bishops received [authority](#church/authority 'Greek') from apostles; the church receives truth from bishops. This is *apostolic succession*—unbroken chain of transmission.

**Historical Reality**: The apostles are dead. Who preserves apostolic teaching? Three answers:
- **Catholic/Orthodox**: Bishops in succession from the apostles
- **Protestant**: Scripture as apostolic testimony
- **Pentecostal**: The Spirit continuing apostolic signs and wonders

**Implication**: Each tradition claims *apostolic* authority and denies it to others.

# Protestant Reformation: New Marks

The Reformers rejected the Catholic claim that apostolic succession through bishops guarantees the true church. They proposed *functional* marks instead of *institutional* ones:

## The Word Rightly Preached
Luther: "The church is the assembly of those who have the Word of God and are purified and sanctified by it." Where the gospel is proclaimed purely, there is the church.

But who decides "rightly"? Lutheran vs. Reformed vs. Anabaptist—each claimed to preach the Word rightly and condemned the others.

## The Sacraments Rightly Administered
Calvin: The church is "wherever we see the Word of God purely preached and heard, and the sacraments administered according to Christ's institution."

But "rightly administered" became another point of division:
- How many sacraments? Two (Protestant) or seven (Catholic)?
- Who can administer them? Only ordained clergy (Lutheran, Reformed) or any believer (Anabaptist)?
- What do they *do*? Confer grace ex opere operato (Catholic), seal grace (Reformed), or symbolize grace (Zwinglian)?

## Church Discipline (sometimes)
Calvin added discipline as a mark: The church must exclude unrepentant sinners to maintain holiness (Matt 18:15-17, 1 Cor 5:1-5).

But this too became divisive: Who has [authority](#church/authority 'Greek') to discipline? Elders (Presbyterian), congregation (Baptist), or bishop (Episcopal)?

# The Problem with Marks

The marks of the church were meant to *unify* by identifying the true church. But they *divided* by giving each tradition a weapon against others.

## Each Tradition Claims the Marks
- **Catholic**: We are one (under the Pope), holy (sanctified by sacraments), catholic (universal), apostolic (bishops in succession).
- **Orthodox**: We are one (in liturgy and tradition), holy (mystical body), catholic (orthodox everywhere), apostolic (unbroken succession).
- **Protestant**: We are one (in Christ, not institution), holy (justified by faith), catholic (gospel for all), apostolic (Scripture, not bishops).

Each claims the marks and denies them to others. The marks become tools of exclusion, not unity.

## Ideal vs. Empirical
The marks describe an *invisible* church (ideal essence) that does not match the *visible* church (empirical reality):
- The church is *essentially* one, but *empirically* divided
- The church is *positionally* holy, but *actually* sinful
- The church is *theoretically* universal, but *practically* provincial
- The church is *doctrinally* apostolic, but *historically* corrupted

This Platonic split between essence and appearance allows any institution to claim the marks while excusing its failures.

## Descriptive or Prescriptive?
Are the marks *what the church is* or *what the church should become*?

If descriptive: They fail—the visible church is divided, sinful, provincial, unfaithful.

If prescriptive: They are goals, not tests. But then they cannot identify the true church *now*—only judge whether churches are moving toward the ideal.

# Hebrew Alternative: The Church as Event

The Hebrew approach resists defining essence. The church is not *what it is* (essence) but *what it does* (event).

The [assembly](#church/assembly 'Hebrew') gathers. The [body](#church/body 'Hebrew') responds to its Head. The [covenant community](#church/covenant-community 'Hebrew') lives in relationship with God.

Instead of asking "What marks identify the true church?", ask "Where is God's people responding to His call?"

Not: "Which institution has the right structure, doctrine, and succession?"
But: "Where is the Spirit moving? Where is Christ preached? Where are lives transformed?"

This is messy. It does not give clear boundaries. You cannot draw a line: "This is in, that is out."

But perhaps that is the point. The Hebrew Scriptures rarely define Israel's *essence*. They narrate Israel's *history*—covenant made and broken, judgment and restoration, exile and return. Israel is not defined by marks; Israel is known by relationship with YHWH.

Similarly, the church is not identified by checklist. The church is wherever Christ is present by His Spirit, calling His people to Himself.

# Can Both Be True?

The marks tradition is not useless. Unity, holiness, universality, apostolicity—these are biblical ideals worth pursuing. The question is whether they should be used as *identity markers* or *aspirational goals*.

Greek thinking: Define the marks, then identify which [institution](#church/institution 'Greek') possesses them.
Hebrew thinking: The church *becomes* one, holy, catholic, apostolic as it follows Christ—not by possessing essential properties, but by living in covenant.

Perhaps the marks should humble us: None of our institutions fully embodies them. We are divided, compromised, provincial, and prone to drift. The marks judge us, not justify us.

The church is one—but we are divided.
The church is holy—but we are sinful.
The church is catholic—but we are tribal.
The church is apostolic—but we forget the gospel.

The marks are eschatological: What the church will be when Christ returns, not what it claims to be now.

"Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify her... that He might present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish" (Eph 5:25-27).

Not yet. But one day.
