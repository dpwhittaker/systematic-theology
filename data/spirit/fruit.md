title: Fruit of the Spirit
---
[The Holy Spirit](#spirit/spirit 'Parent')
---
The Spirit produces *fruit* in believers—moral character, not just miraculous [gifts](#spirit/gifts 'Greek'). Transformation of character over time, not instant perfection.

**Galatians 5:22-23:** "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."

Nine virtues, singular "fruit" (not "fruits"). This is one unified harvest of the Spirit's work, not a menu to choose from.

**The contrast:** "Works of the flesh" (Galatians 5:19-21) vs. "fruit of the Spirit" (5:22-23). Walking by the flesh produces sin; walking by the Spirit produces holiness.

**The method:** Not self-effort, but dependence. "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Galatians 5:16). The fruit grows as we abide in Christ (John 15:4-5).

This is the Spirit's [power](#spirit/power 'Hebrew') for sanctification, the Spirit's [presence](#spirit/presence 'Hebrew') transforming us from within. Character > charisma. Fruit > gifts.

# Fruit of the Spirit

The most famous passage on the Spirit's moral work is Galatians 5:22-23. This is not about miraculous gifts but about character transformation—the slow, steady growth of Christlikeness in the believer.

## The Text: Galatians 5:22-23

**Galatians 5:22-23:** "But the fruit of the Spirit is *love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control*; against such things there is no law."

Nine virtues. But notice: "fruit" is *singular*, not "fruits." This is one unified fruit with nine aspects, not nine separate fruits you pick and choose from.

The Spirit produces a complete harvest of character. You don't get to have joy without patience, or love without self-control. It's a package—the whole fruit of the Spirit.

## The Context: Flesh vs. Spirit

Paul contrasts two ways of living:

### Works of the Flesh (Galatians 5:19-21)

**Galatians 5:19-21:** "Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."

These are "works" (plural)—actions produced by living according to the flesh (sinful human nature).

**Pattern:** Self-centered, destructive, chaotic. The flesh produces division, conflict, impurity.

### Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)

**Galatians 5:22-23:** "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."

This is "fruit" (singular)—the organic result of living by the Spirit.

**Pattern:** Other-centered, constructive, harmonious. The Spirit produces unity, purity, love.

**The warning:** Those who practice the works of the flesh "will not inherit the kingdom of God" (5:21). True believers walk by the Spirit and produce the fruit of the Spirit.

## The Command: Walk by the Spirit

**Galatians 5:16:** "But I say, *walk by the Spirit*, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

"Walk" (*peripateō*) means to conduct your life, to order your behavior. It's a daily, continuous action.

**The promise:** If you walk by the Spirit, you *will not* gratify the flesh. The Spirit empowers you to resist sin.

**Galatians 5:25:** "If we live by the Spirit, *let us also keep in step with the Spirit*."

"Keep in step" (*stoicheō*) means to walk in line with, to march in formation. The Spirit sets the pace; we follow.

**The method is not self-effort.** You don't grit your teeth and try harder. You *depend on the Spirit*. You walk in step with Him, and He produces the fruit.

## The Nine Virtues

### 1. Love (Agapē)

**Love** is first—and foundational. All other fruit flows from love.

**1 Corinthians 13:13:** "So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love."

**Romans 5:5:** "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."

The Spirit pours God's love into us, and that love overflows toward others.

**John 13:34-35:** "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."

Love is the mark of a disciple. Without it, you have nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-3).

### 2. Joy (Chara)

**Joy** is not happiness (dependent on circumstances) but deep gladness rooted in God.

**Nehemiah 8:10:** "The joy of the Lord is your strength."

**John 15:11:** Jesus says, "These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."

**Romans 14:17:** "The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and *joy in the Holy Spirit*."

Joy comes from the Spirit, not from favorable circumstances. Even in suffering, the Spirit gives joy (1 Thessalonians 1:6, "You received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit").

### 3. Peace (Eirēnē)

**Peace** is wholeness, harmony, rest—both with God and with others.

**Romans 5:1:** "Since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

Peace *with* God (vertical) leads to peace *within* yourself and peace *with* others (horizontal).

**Philippians 4:6-7:** "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

The Spirit guards your heart with peace, even when circumstances are chaotic.

**Colossians 3:15:** "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body."

Peace in the community of believers is the Spirit's work.

### 4. Patience (Makrothumia)

**Patience** (also translated "longsuffering") is endurance under provocation—being slow to anger, willing to wait.

**Exodus 34:6:** "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger (*makrothumos* in Greek OT)."

God is patient with us. The Spirit produces that same patience in us toward others.

**James 5:7-8:** "Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains. You also, be patient."

Patience is waiting without complaining, enduring without bitterness.

**2 Peter 3:9:** "The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."

God's patience leads to salvation. The Spirit's patience in us reflects God's character.

### 5. Kindness (Chrēstotēs)

**Kindness** is goodness in action—benevolence, generosity, gentleness toward others.

**Romans 2:4:** "Do you presume on the riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?"

God's kindness draws us to Himself. The Spirit's kindness in us draws others.

**Ephesians 4:32:** "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."

Kindness is the reflex of forgiven people. You've received kindness from God; extend it to others.

**Titus 3:4-5:** "When the goodness and loving *kindness* of God our Savior appeared, He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy."

Kindness is central to God's character. The Spirit makes us kind like God.

### 6. Goodness (Agathōsunē)

**Goodness** is moral excellence, uprightness, integrity.

**Romans 15:14:** "I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another."

Goodness flows from the Spirit's filling. It's moral character, not just moral action.

**Ephesians 5:9:** "The fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true."

Goodness is walking in the light—living rightly, transparently, honestly.

**2 Thessalonians 1:11:** "To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of His calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by His power."

Goodness is God's power at work in us—Spirit-produced, not self-generated.

### 7. Faithfulness (Pistis)

**Faithfulness** (also "faith" or "fidelity") is reliability, trustworthiness, steadfastness.

**Lamentations 3:22-23:** "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is Your *faithfulness*."

God is faithful. The Spirit makes us faithful like God—dependable, loyal, true to our word.

**1 Corinthians 4:2:** "It is required of stewards that they be found *faithful*."

The test of a disciple is not talent or success, but faithfulness. Do you keep going when it's hard?

**Revelation 2:10:** "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."

Faithfulness endures to the end. The Spirit sustains us in faithfulness.

### 8. Gentleness (Prautēs)

**Gentleness** (also "meekness") is strength under control—humility, mildness, non-retaliation.

**Matthew 5:5:** "Blessed are the meek (*praus*), for they shall inherit the earth."

Meekness is not weakness. It's power restrained by humility.

**Matthew 11:29:** Jesus says, "Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am gentle (*praus*) and lowly in heart."

Jesus is the model of gentleness—mighty yet humble, strong yet kind.

**1 Peter 3:15:** "In your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with *gentleness* and respect."

Gentleness marks our witness. We speak truth without arrogance, defend the faith without hostility.

**James 3:13:** "Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom."

Wisdom and gentleness go together. True wisdom is humble, not proud.

### 9. Self-Control (Enkrateia)

**Self-control** is mastery over desires—restraint, discipline, moderation.

**1 Corinthians 9:25:** "Every athlete exercises *self-control* in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable."

Self-control is necessary for the Christian race. We discipline ourselves to pursue holiness.

**Titus 2:11-12:** "The grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live *self-controlled*, upright, and godly lives in the present age."

Grace trains us in self-control. It's not legalism—it's the Spirit's power enabling us to say no to sin.

**2 Peter 1:6:** Add to your faith "virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge *self-control*, and to self-control steadfastness."

Self-control is part of spiritual maturity. It grows as we grow in the Spirit.

## Fruit vs. Gifts

Paul intentionally contrasts *fruit* with the *gifts* he discussed earlier (1 Corinthians 12-14).

### Gifts Are About Power

- Miraculous, visible, impressive
- For the common good (1 Corinthians 12:7)
- Distributed as the Spirit wills (1 Corinthians 12:11)
- Not everyone has the same gifts (1 Corinthians 12:29-30)

### Fruit Is About Character

- Moral, internal, slow-growing
- For personal holiness and witness
- Required of all believers (Galatians 5:22-23 applies to everyone)
- All Christians should exhibit all nine aspects

### Love Is Greater Than Gifts

**1 Corinthians 13:1-3:** "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing."

You can have all the gifts—tongues, prophecy, miracles, knowledge—but without love (the first fruit), you have *nothing*.

**1 Corinthians 13:8:** "Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away."

Gifts are temporary (they'll cease when Christ returns). Love is eternal.

**Pursue fruit over gifts.** Don't obsess over charismatic manifestations. Focus on Christlike character.

## How Does Fruit Grow?

The key question: If this is the Spirit's fruit, how do we cultivate it?

### 1. Abide in Christ (John 15:4-5)

**John 15:4-5:** "Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in Me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing."

**Abiding** is the secret. You don't *produce* fruit by effort; you *bear* fruit by remaining connected to Jesus.

A branch doesn't strain to grow grapes. It stays attached to the vine, and fruit happens naturally.

**How to abide:**
- Prayer (John 15:7, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish")
- Obedience (John 15:10, "If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love")
- Dependence (John 15:5, "Apart from Me you can do nothing")

### 2. Walk by the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, 25)

**Galatians 5:16:** "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

Walking by the Spirit means:
- **Dependence:** Relying on the Spirit's power, not self-effort
- **Obedience:** Following the Spirit's leading (Romans 8:14, "All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God")
- **Moment-by-moment surrender:** Not a one-time decision, but daily yielding

### 3. Put to Death the Deeds of the Flesh (Romans 8:13)

**Romans 8:13:** "If you live according to the flesh you will die, but if *by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body*, you will live."

**Active cooperation with the Spirit:**
- The Spirit empowers, but you *act*
- You "put to death" sin—not passively, but aggressively
- Mortification (killing sin) is the Spirit's work *through* your obedience

**Colossians 3:5:** "Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness."

### 4. Be Filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18)

**Ephesians 5:18:** "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but *be filled with the Spirit*."

Present imperative: "Be being filled"—continuous, ongoing.

**How to be filled:**
- Ask (Luke 11:13, "How much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!")
- Confess sin (Ephesians 4:30, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit")
- Yield (Romans 6:13, "Present yourselves to God")

### 5. Renew Your Mind (Romans 12:2)

**Romans 12:2:** "Do not be conformed to this world, but *be transformed by the renewal of your mind*, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect."

Fruit grows as your mind is renewed by Scripture, prayer, worship.

**Philippians 4:8:** "Whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, *think about these things*."

What you dwell on shapes what you become. Fill your mind with truth, and the Spirit produces fruit.

## The Timeline: Growth, Not Perfection

The fruit of the Spirit is not instant. It's *growth*.

**2 Corinthians 3:18:** "We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being *transformed* into the same image from one degree of glory to another."

"Being transformed"—present tense, ongoing. It's a process, not an event.

**Philippians 1:6:** "He who began a good work in you will *bring it to completion* at the day of Jesus Christ."

God is still working. You're not finished yet.

**1 John 3:2:** "Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when He appears we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is."

Full Christlikeness comes when we see Jesus face to face. Until then, we're in process.

**Don't be discouraged by slow growth.** Fruit takes time. An apple tree doesn't produce apples overnight. It takes years of roots growing deep, branches strengthening, seasons passing.

The Spirit is at work. Trust the process.

## The Evidence of the Spirit

How do you know you have the Spirit? Not by miraculous gifts (not everyone has those). By *fruit*.

**Matthew 7:16, 20:** "You will recognize them by their fruits... Thus you will recognize them by their fruits."

The test of authentic faith is not spiritual experiences or charismatic gifts—it's character.

**Galatians 5:24:** "Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."

If you belong to Christ, the flesh is being put to death, and the Spirit is producing fruit.

**The question is not:** "Have you spoken in tongues? Have you prophesied?"
**The question is:** "Is your life marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control?"

That's the evidence of the Spirit's indwelling.

## Conclusion: The Spirit's Transforming Work

The fruit of the Spirit is the proof of the Spirit's presence.

Gifts are impressive. Fruit is essential.

Gifts demonstrate power. Fruit demonstrates character.

Gifts can be counterfeited. Fruit cannot.

**Galatians 5:22-23:** "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law."

"Against such things there is no law"—meaning, no one can condemn these. They are universally good, undeniably Christlike.

**This is the Spirit's work:** Making you like Jesus. Slowly, steadily, transforming you from one degree of glory to another.

**Walk by the Spirit. Abide in Christ. Bear much fruit.**

"I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in Me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).
