title: Ruach - Breath of God
---
[The Holy Spirit](#spirit/spirit 'Parent')
---
In Hebrew, *ruach* means breath, wind, spirit. Not a [person](#spirit/person 'Greek'), but God's life-force animating creation.

**Key Old Testament usage:**
- Genesis 1:2 - "The Spirit of God (*ruach Elohim*) was hovering over the waters"
- Genesis 2:7 - "He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life (*nishmat chaim*)"
- Judges 14:6 - "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon Samson" (power for action)
- Isaiah 11:2 - "The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him" (wisdom, counsel, might)

This is God's [presence](#spirit/presence 'Hebrew') and [power](#spirit/power 'Hebrew'), not a third person of the Trinity. The Greek ontological question "Who is the Spirit?" may miss the Hebrew functional testimony: "What does God's Spirit do?"

# Ruach: The Breath of God

The Hebrew word *ruach* (רוּחַ) is foundational to understanding the Spirit in Scripture. But it doesn't mean "person"—it means breath, wind, spirit. It's about *movement, life, power*—not ontological distinction.

## The Word Itself

*Ruach* has three primary meanings in Hebrew:

### 1. Wind (Physical Breath of Air)

**Exodus 10:13:** "The Lord brought an east wind (*ruach*) upon the land all that day and all that night."
**Jonah 1:4:** "The Lord hurled a great wind (*ruach*) upon the sea."
**Genesis 8:1:** "God made a wind (*ruach*) blow over the earth, and the waters subsided."

This is literal, physical wind—moving air.

### 2. Breath (Life Force)

**Genesis 2:7:** "The Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life (*nishmat chaim*), and the man became a living creature (*nephesh*)."
**Psalm 104:29-30:** "When You take away their breath (*ruach*), they die and return to the dust. When You send forth Your Spirit (*ruach*), they are created."
**Job 34:14-15:** "If He should set His heart to it and gather to Himself His spirit (*ruach*) and His breath (*neshamah*), all flesh would perish together."

*Ruach* is what animates, what gives life. Without it, creatures die.

### 3. Spirit (Inner Disposition, God's Presence)

**Numbers 5:14:** "If a spirit (*ruach*) of jealousy comes over him..."
**1 Kings 21:5:** "Why is your spirit (*ruach*) so vexed?"
**Isaiah 61:3:** "The garment of praise instead of a faint spirit (*ruach*)"

And when applied to God:
**Genesis 1:2:** "The Spirit of God (*ruach Elohim*) was hovering over the face of the waters."
**Psalm 51:11:** "Do not take Your Holy Spirit (*ruach kodesh*) from me."
**Isaiah 63:10:** "They rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit (*ruach kodesh*)."

## The Pattern: Wind → Breath → Spirit

The genius of Hebrew is that *ruach* carries all three meanings. They're not separate concepts—they're a spectrum:

**Wind:** Air in motion, powerful, invisible, unpredictable
**Breath:** Wind entering a body, giving life, sustaining
**Spirit:** The life-force, the animating presence, the inner reality

God's *ruach* is like wind—powerful, moving, invisible. It's like breath—giving life, sustaining creation. It's like spirit—dwelling within, empowering, transforming.

**This is not personhood. It's function.**

## Ruach Elohim in the Old Testament

How does the Old Testament use "Spirit of God"? Not as a distinct person, but as *God's active presence*.

### Creation: God's Breath Animates

**Genesis 1:2:** "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God (*ruach Elohim*) was hovering over the face of the waters."

The word "hovering" (*merachefet*) is the same word used for a bird hovering over its nest (Deuteronomy 32:11). The Spirit is God's life-giving presence brooding over creation, preparing to bring order from chaos.

**Psalm 33:6:** "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth (*ruach*) all their host."

Creation happens by God's Word *and* God's breath. Not two persons, but two aspects of God's creative power.

**Job 33:4:** "The Spirit of God (*ruach El*) has made me, and the breath of the Almighty (*nishmat Shaddai*) gives me life."

God's *ruach* is His creative, life-giving power. It makes, it animates, it sustains.

### Empowerment: God's Spirit Comes Upon

When God's *ruach* comes upon someone, they are empowered for a task—not indwelt as a permanent person, but *enabled* by God's power.

**Judges 14:6:** "The Spirit of the Lord (*ruach YHWH*) rushed upon [Samson], and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces."

Samson doesn't receive a person. God's power surges into him for a specific act.

**Judges 6:34:** "The Spirit of the Lord (*ruach YHWH*) clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet."

The Spirit "clothes" Gideon—wraps him in power, enabling leadership.

**1 Samuel 10:6:** Samuel tells Saul, "The Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy... and be turned into another man."

This is transformation by divine power, not personal indwelling.

**1 Samuel 16:13:** "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward."

David is anointed king, and God's empowering presence rests on him.

**Key pattern:** The Spirit *comes upon* people for specific purposes—judging (Othniel), delivering (Samson), leading (Gideon), prophesying (Saul). This is *functional*, not *relational*. God empowers for a task.

### Prophecy: God's Spirit Enables Speech

The clearest function of *ruach* in the Old Testament is enabling prophecy.

**Numbers 11:25:** "The Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to [Moses], and took some of the Spirit (*ruach*) that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied."

The Spirit is *transferable*—it goes from Moses to the elders, enabling them to prophesy. This is not a person dwelling in them; it's God's power enabling divine speech.

**2 Samuel 23:2:** "The Spirit of the Lord (*ruach YHWH*) speaks by me; His word is on my tongue."

David attributes his words to God's Spirit—divine inspiration.

**Ezekiel 11:5:** "The Spirit of the Lord (*ruach YHWH*) fell upon me, and He said to me, 'Say...'"

The Spirit "falls upon" Ezekiel, and God speaks through him.

**Micah 3:8:** "But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord (*ruach YHWH*), and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression."

The Spirit is the *power* that enables Micah to speak God's word.

**Pattern:** The Spirit enables prophetic speech. It's God's power working *through* the prophet, not a distinct person dwelling *in* the prophet.

### Indwelling: God's Spirit Sustains Life

In a few key texts, the Spirit is not just external power but *internal* sustaining presence.

**Psalm 51:11:** "Do not cast me from Your presence (*paneka*, lit. "Your face") or take Your Holy Spirit (*ruach kodesh*) from me."

David fears losing God's presence. The Spirit here is intimately connected to God's presence—if the Spirit departs, God departs.

**Psalm 139:7:** "Where shall I go from Your Spirit (*ruach*)? Or where shall I flee from Your presence (*paneka*)?"

Again, Spirit and presence are parallel. To flee God's Spirit is to flee God's presence. They're not two entities—the Spirit *is* God's presence.

**Isaiah 63:10-11:** "They rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit (*ruach kodesh*); therefore He turned to be their enemy... Where is He who put in the midst of them His Holy Spirit?"

Israel grieved God by rebelling. God's Spirit was "in their midst"—among them, with them. When they rebelled, the Spirit departed (meaning God's favor and presence withdrew).

**Pattern:** The Spirit is God's *presence*. To have the Spirit is to have God near. To grieve the Spirit is to grieve God. The Spirit is not someone *other than* God—it's God *with* His people.

### The Promised Outpouring

The prophets looked forward to a day when God's Spirit would be poured out *abundantly*, not just on select individuals but on *all* God's people.

**Ezekiel 36:26-27:** "I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit (*ruach*) I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit (*ruach*) within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes."

This is God's *indwelling* power, transforming from within. Not a person moving in, but God's life-giving, law-writing power residing in His people.

**Ezekiel 37:14:** "I will put My Spirit (*ruach*) within you, and you shall live."

The valley of dry bones comes to life when God's Spirit enters. The Spirit is *life-force*, the animating breath.

**Joel 2:28-29:** "I will pour out My Spirit (*ruach*) on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out My Spirit."

The Spirit is *poured out* like water (Isaiah 44:3). This is not the language of persons but of power, presence, enabling.

**Pattern:** The future hope is that God's empowering, life-giving, transforming presence will not be limited to prophets, kings, and judges—it will rest on *all* God's people.

## Ruach HaKodesh: The Holy Spirit in Judaism

In later Jewish writings (Mishnah, Talmud, rabbinic literature), *Ruach HaKodesh* (Holy Spirit) is a standard term. But it never means a distinct person within God.

### What Ruach HaKodesh Means in the Talmud

**Talmud Sotah 48b:** "After the last prophets—Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi—died, the Holy Spirit departed from Israel."

This doesn't mean a divine person left. It means *prophetic inspiration* ceased. No more direct revelation from God in the prophetic mode.

**Talmud Sanhedrin 11a:** "The Holy Spirit rested upon the members of the Great Assembly."

The Spirit "rests upon" leaders, enabling wisdom and judgment. This is divine *enablement*, not personal *indwelling*.

**Talmud Megillah 7a:** "From the day the Temple was destroyed, prophecy was taken from prophets and given to fools and children."

The loss of the Temple corresponds to the loss of the Spirit's prophetic function. God's Spirit was connected to the covenant community's faithfulness, not to a person dwelling irrespective of obedience.

**Mishna Avot 6:2:** "Every day a heavenly voice (*bat kol*, "daughter of a voice") goes forth from Mount Horeb."

After the Spirit's departure, God speaks through *bat kol*—an echo, a secondary voice. Not the full prophetic Ruach HaKodesh, but a lesser form of divine communication.

### Key Rabbinic Principle: The Spirit as Divine Inspiration

Judaism never treats Ruach HaKodesh as a person. It's:
- **Prophetic inspiration:** God enabling speech (prophecy, interpretation of Torah)
- **Wisdom:** Divine insight granted to sages
- **Power for miracles:** God working through faithful individuals (rare in rabbinic period)
- **God's presence:** The Shekinah, God dwelling with His people (especially in the Temple)

**Never:** A third person of a Trinity, subsisting eternally in the divine essence.

## The New Testament's Use of Ruach/Pneuma

The New Testament is written in Greek, but the concepts are Hebrew. *Pneuma* (πνεῦμα) translates *ruach* and carries the same range of meanings: wind, breath, spirit.

### Pentecost: The Fulfillment of Joel's Prophecy

**Acts 2:2-4:** "Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind (*pnoe*, related to *pneuma*), and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit (*pneuma hagion*) and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance."

**Acts 2:16-17:** Peter quotes Joel 2:28—"I will pour out My Spirit (*pneuma*) on all flesh."

This is *ruach* language:
- Wind (mighty rushing wind)
- Fire (God's presence, like Sinai)
- Pouring out (like water, like power descending)
- Speech (prophetic utterance)

The Spirit at Pentecost is the fulfillment of the Old Testament hope: God's empowering, prophetic, life-giving presence now poured out on *all* who believe, not just select prophets.

**Is this a person descending, or God's power poured out?**

The language is functional, not ontological. The Spirit *enables*, *empowers*, *inspires*—just like *ruach* in the Old Testament.

### Jesus and the Spirit

**Luke 4:18-19:** Jesus reads Isaiah 61 in the synagogue: "The Spirit of the Lord (*pneuma kyriou*) is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to proclaim good news to the poor."

This is classic Old Testament anointing language. The Spirit comes *upon* the Messiah to empower His mission. Not personal indwelling, but divine enablement.

**Matthew 3:16:** At Jesus' baptism, "He saw the Spirit of God (*pneuma theou*) descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him."

Again, the Spirit *rests upon* Jesus. This is Messianic anointing—God's power equipping the King.

**John 3:34:** "He whom God has sent utters the words of God, for He gives the Spirit without measure."

The Spirit is given in fullness to Jesus, enabling His ministry.

**Luke 4:1:** "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit (*pneuma hagion*), returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness."

The Spirit *leads* Jesus. This could be personal agency—or it could be God's guiding presence, described metaphorically.

### Paul and the Spirit

Paul uses *pneuma* over 140 times. Sometimes it clearly means the human spirit (Romans 8:16, "our spirit"), sometimes the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9, "the Spirit of God").

**Romans 8:9-11:** "You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit (*pneuma*), if indeed the Spirit of God (*pneuma theou*) dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ (*pneuma Christou*) does not belong to Him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit (*pneuma*) who dwells in you."

Notice the interchangeability:
- Spirit of God
- Spirit of Christ
- Christ in you
- Spirit dwells in you

Is this three persons, or different ways of describing *God's indwelling presence*?

**2 Corinthians 3:17-18:** "Now the Lord is the Spirit (*pneuma*), and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit (*pneuma*)."

"The Lord *is* the Spirit." This is identity language. The Spirit is not a separate person alongside the Lord—the Spirit *is* the Lord's presence.

**Galatians 4:6:** "God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'"

The Spirit is "the Spirit of His Son"—belonging to Jesus, sent by the Father. This could be relational (persons sending persons) or functional (God's presence, associated with Christ's work, dwelling in believers).

### The Wind Metaphor

**John 3:8:** "The wind (*pneuma*) blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit (*pneuma*)."

Jesus uses the double meaning of *pneuma*—wind and Spirit. The Spirit is like wind: invisible, powerful, unpredictable, life-giving.

This is *ruach* theology. The Spirit is breath, wind, power. Not a person you see, but a force you experience.

## The Hebrew Framework: Not "Who" But "What"

The Hebrew approach to the Spirit doesn't ask, "Who is the Spirit?" (Greek ontological question). It asks, "What does the Spirit do?" (Hebrew functional question).

### What the Spirit Does

**Creates:** Genesis 1:2, Job 33:4—the Spirit hovers over chaos, brings life
**Empowers:** Judges 14:6, 1 Samuel 16:13—the Spirit rushes upon judges and kings for mighty acts
**Inspires:** Numbers 11:25, 2 Samuel 23:2—the Spirit enables prophecy, divine speech
**Sustains:** Psalm 104:30, Job 34:14-15—the Spirit gives life, without it creatures die
**Transforms:** Ezekiel 36:26-27—the Spirit writes God's law on hearts, changes inner disposition
**Indwells:** Romans 8:9-11, 1 Corinthians 6:19—the Spirit dwells in believers, making them God's temple
**Intercedes:** Romans 8:26—the Spirit prays within us with groans too deep for words
**Sanctifies:** 2 Thessalonians 2:13, 1 Peter 1:2—the Spirit makes believers holy

These are all *functions*—things the Spirit *does*. Hebrew thought is comfortable leaving it there: God's Spirit does these things because the Spirit *is* God at work.

### Not a Third Person

Greek theology asks: If the Spirit does all this, the Spirit must be *someone*. You can't create, inspire, intercede unless you're a person.

Hebrew theology responds: Why not? God's Word goes forth and accomplishes His purpose (Isaiah 55:11). God's Wisdom calls out and builds (Proverbs 8). God's Presence dwells in the Temple (1 Kings 8:10-11). None of these are separate persons—they're ways of talking about *God's activity*.

The Spirit is God's *ruach*—His breath, His power, His presence. When the Spirit creates, *God* creates. When the Spirit indwells, *God* indwells. When the Spirit transforms, *God* transforms.

**One God. One Spirit. God at work in the world.**

## The Strength: Preserving Mystery

The Hebrew framework doesn't answer the Greek question, "How can the Spirit be God yet distinct from the Father?" It doesn't try to. It leaves the mystery intact:

**Testimony without system:**
- God is one (Deuteronomy 6:4)
- God's Spirit fills creation (Psalm 104:30)
- God's Spirit dwells in believers (Romans 8:9)
- God's Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son (John 14:26, 15:26)

We confess all of this as true. We don't force it into Greek categories (essence, person, procession). We testify to *what God has done* without systematizing *how He exists*.

## The Challenge: Can This Be Trinitarian?

The obvious objection: If the Spirit is not a distinct person, you've denied the Trinity. You've collapsed into modalism or Unitarianism.

**But consider:** The Trinity itself is a Greek construct. It's not in Scripture—it's a theological system built *from* Scripture using Greek philosophical categories.

If you reject those categories, you don't automatically reject biblical faith. You reject one *interpretation* of biblical faith.

**The Hebrew alternative:**
- God is one
- God reveals Himself as Father (Creator, source)
- God reveals Himself as Son (Redeemer, incarnate)
- God reveals Himself as Spirit (Presence, power)

These are not three persons in one essence. They're three ways the one God acts and is known.

Is this modalism? Maybe. Or maybe it's the biblical testimony without the Greek overlay.

## Conclusion: The Breath of the Living God

*Ruach* is breath. Wind. Life. Power. Presence.

It's not "the third person of the Trinity, eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son."

It's *God's animating force*, moving over creation, giving life, empowering judges, inspiring prophets, transforming hearts, dwelling in believers.

**The question:** Is this enough? Can we worship, live, and theologize with *ruach* as the category—or do we need "person"?

Classical theology says we need "person" to protect the Spirit's deity and avoid heresy.

Hebrew thought asks: Or does "person" distort the revelation by imposing Greek categories on Hebrew testimony?

The Spirit as *ruach*: God's breath, wind, life. Not tamed by our systems. Not defined by our philosophy. Known in experience, worshiped in awe.

Perhaps that's closer to the truth.
