[The Holy Spirit](#spirit/spirit 'Parent')

This site's position—that the Spirit is God's [presence](#spirit/presence 'Hebrew') and [power](#spirit/power 'Hebrew'), not a distinct "person" (hypostasis)—would be condemned by the councils.

**Likely charges:**
- [Modalism](#spirit/heresy#modalism 'Drill') (Sabellianism): Father, Son, Spirit are modes, not persons
- [Pneumatomachianism](#spirit/heresy#pneumatomachi 'Drill'): Denying the Spirit's full deity
- [Unitarianism](#spirit/heresy#unitarianism 'Drill'): Collapsing the distinctions entirely

**Our response:** We affirm the Spirit's deity. We question whether Greek "person" language is *required*—or whether it imports categories Scripture doesn't use. The [biblical pattern](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew') may be sufficient without Greek metaphysics.

Is questioning Nicaea heresy? Or is it asking whether the councils answered the right questions?

# Heresy? Addressing the Charges

This site takes a position that the historic church councils would likely condemn. We should be honest about that.

The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (381 AD) and subsequent councils established that the Holy Spirit is:
- Fully God (homoousios with the Father)
- A distinct "person" (hypostasis) within the Godhead
- Worthy of worship alongside the Father and Son
- Eternally proceeding from the Father (and the Son, in Western tradition)

Our position—that the Spirit is God's presence and power, described with [interchangeable terms](#spirit/ruach#ruach-elohim-ruach-yhwh-ruach-hakodesh-one-spirit 'Hebrew') in Scripture, and never commanded as a separate object of worship—challenges at least some of these claims.

What heresies might we be accused of?

## Modalism (Sabellianism) {#modalism}

### The Heresy

**Modalism** (also called Sabellianism, after Sabellius of Rome, ~3rd century) teaches that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three distinct persons but three *modes* or *manifestations* of the one God.

**The modalist claim:**
- God is one person who appears in different forms
- As Father, He creates and gives the Law
- As Son, He redeems and saves
- As Spirit, He sanctifies and indwells
- These are successive roles, not simultaneous persons

**Why it was condemned:**
- It seems to deny that Jesus prayed to a *real* Father (just talking to Himself?)
- It collapses the distinctions Scripture maintains (the Father sends the Son; the Son sends the Spirit)
- It makes the baptism of Jesus incoherent (Father speaks, Spirit descends, Son is baptized—all one person playing three roles?)

### Are We Modalists?

**The accusation would be:** If you say the Spirit is just "God's presence" rather than a distinct person, you've collapsed the Spirit into the Father. That's modalism.

**Our response:**

1. **We affirm real distinctions.** The Father is not the Son. The Son prays to the Father. The Spirit is sent by both. Scripture presents these as genuinely distinct—not one person playing roles.

2. **We question whether "person" is the right category.** The Greek word *hypostasis* (underlying reality, concrete instance) was borrowed from philosophy to describe the distinctions. But is that the *only* way to honor the distinctions?

3. **The Hebrew alternative:** Scripture speaks of:
   - The **Father** as source, creator, the one we worship
   - The **Son** as the incarnate one, filled with the Spirit, whom we also worship
   - The **Spirit of God** as God's breath, presence, power—*how* God is active in the world

   These are real distinctions. But they may be *relational* and *functional* distinctions, not *ontological* ones (three "persons" sharing one "substance").

4. **Modalism's error was collapsing the Son into the Father.** We're not doing that. We affirm Jesus is distinct from the Father—He prays to Him, is sent by Him, returns to Him. The question is specifically about the Spirit: Is the Spirit a *third* hypostasis, or is the Spirit *how God (Father and Son) is present with us*?

**Verdict:** We are not classical modalists. We affirm Father-Son distinction. We question whether the Spirit requires a *third* hypostasis or whether "Spirit of God" is sufficient biblical language.

## Pneumatomachianism (Macedonianism) {#pneumatomachi}

### The Heresy

**Pneumatomachianism** ("Spirit-fighters") was a 4th-century movement associated with Macedonius of Constantinople. They accepted the Nicene Creed's affirmation of the Son's deity but denied the Spirit's full deity.

**The pneumatomachian claim:**
- The Spirit is a creature, not God
- The Spirit is subordinate to Father and Son
- The Spirit is a ministering spirit, like angels, not co-equal with God

**Why it was condemned:**
- Scripture calls the Spirit "Lord" (2 Corinthians 3:17)
- The Spirit is associated with divine acts (creation, resurrection, sanctification)
- Lying to the Spirit is lying to God (Acts 5:3-4)
- The baptismal formula puts Spirit alongside Father and Son (Matthew 28:19)

The Council of Constantinople (381 AD) responded by expanding the Nicene Creed:

> "And [we believe] in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who **with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified**, who spoke by the prophets."

### Are We Pneumatomachians?

**The accusation would be:** If you deny the Spirit is a distinct person, you're demoting the Spirit. That's what the Pneumatomachians did.

**Our response:**

1. **We affirm the Spirit's full deity.** The Spirit is not a creature. The Spirit is not an angel. The Spirit is God—God's own breath, presence, power. When the Spirit acts, *God* acts. When the Spirit indwells, *God* indwells.

2. **We deny nothing about the Spirit's nature—only the Greek category of "person."** Pneumatomachians said the Spirit was a creature. We say the Spirit is God Himself active in the world. That's the opposite of their error.

3. **The worship question is key.** Constantinople says the Spirit "with the Father and Son together is worshipped." But where does Scripture command this?

   **Scripture's pattern:**
   - We pray *to* the Father (Matthew 6:9, John 16:23)
   - We worship the Son (Philippians 2:10-11, Hebrews 1:6, Revelation 5:12)
   - We pray and worship *in* or *by* the Spirit (Ephesians 6:18, Philippians 3:3, John 4:24)

   The Spirit empowers worship. The Spirit is the *medium* of our access to God. But Scripture never says "worship the Spirit" or "pray to the Spirit."

4. **Did Constantinople answer a question Scripture doesn't ask?** The council assumed: If the Spirit is God, the Spirit must be worshipped as a distinct person alongside Father and Son. But what if the Spirit is God's *mode of presence* rather than a *recipient of worship*?

**Verdict:** We are not Pneumatomachians. We affirm the Spirit is fully God. We question whether "distinct person who receives worship" follows from "fully God."

## Unitarianism {#unitarianism}

### The Heresy

**Unitarianism** denies the Trinity entirely. God is one person—the Father. Jesus is not God (perhaps a great teacher or created being). The Spirit is an impersonal force or simply God's activity.

**Why it's rejected:**
- Scripture calls Jesus "God" (John 1:1, 20:28, Titus 2:13)
- Jesus receives worship (Matthew 28:9, Hebrews 1:6)
- Jesus claims divine prerogatives (forgiving sins, Mark 2:5-7; receiving prayer, John 14:14)

### Are We Unitarians?

**The accusation would be:** If you deny the Spirit is a person, next you'll deny the Son is God. It's a slippery slope to Unitarianism.

**Our response:**

1. **We emphatically affirm the Son's deity.** Jesus is [YHWH incarnate](#jesus/lord 'Drill'). He receives worship. He is "God with us." The site's entire Christology section affirms this.

2. **The Son and Spirit are different cases.** Scripture explicitly:
   - Calls Jesus "God" (John 1:1, 20:28)
   - Shows Jesus receiving worship (Matthew 28:9, Philippians 2:10)
   - Records Thomas saying "My Lord and my God" (John 20:28)

   Scripture does *not* explicitly:
   - Call the Spirit "God" as a title (Acts 5:3-4 implies it, but doesn't use it as a name)
   - Show the Spirit receiving worship
   - Record anyone saying "My Lord and my God" to the Spirit

3. **Different biblical data, different conclusions.** We follow the biblical testimony where it leads. For the Son, it leads to deity and worship. For the Spirit, it leads to deity (the Spirit *is* God) but not to a distinct hypostasis receiving worship.

**Verdict:** We are not Unitarians. We affirm the Son's full deity and worship. We simply note that Scripture treats the Spirit differently than it treats the Son.

## The Real Question: Did the Councils Ask the Right Questions?

The councils were responding to real threats:
- Arius denied Christ's deity → Nicaea affirmed it
- Macedonius denied the Spirit's deity → Constantinople affirmed it
- Nestorius seemed to divide Christ → Ephesus/Chalcedon clarified

**But the councils used Greek philosophical categories to answer these threats:**
- *Ousia* (essence, substance)
- *Hypostasis* (person, concrete instance)
- *Homoousios* (same substance)
- *Physis* (nature)

**The question we raise:** Were these categories *necessary*? Or did they import assumptions that created new problems?

### The Assumption Behind "Three Persons"

The councils assumed: To be fully God, the Spirit must be a distinct *hypostasis* (person) who shares the divine *ousia* (essence).

**But why?**

Hebrew Scripture describes God's Spirit as His breath, His presence, His power—[interchangeable with other terms](#spirit/ruach#ruach-elohim-ruach-yhwh-ruach-hakodesh-one-spirit 'Hebrew') for God's activity. The Spirit is fully divine because the Spirit *is* God at work.

Does this require a *third hypostasis*? Or is that a Greek solution to a Greek problem?

### The Problem the Councils Created

By defining the Spirit as a "person" (hypostasis), the councils created questions Scripture doesn't raise:
- How do three persons share one essence without being three gods?
- How does the Spirit "proceed" from the Father (and/or Son)?
- What distinguishes the persons if they share all attributes?

These are fascinating philosophical puzzles. But are they *biblical* questions? Or are they artifacts of the Greek categories imposed on the biblical testimony?

### An Alternative: Biblical Language for Biblical Testimony

What if we simply said:
- **God is one** (Deuteronomy 6:4)
- **The Father** is the source, the one Jesus calls "My God" (John 20:17)
- **The Son** is YHWH incarnate, filled with the Spirit, whom we worship (Philippians 2:10-11)
- **The Spirit of God** is God's breath, presence, power—how God is active in creation and in us

This honors the distinctions Scripture makes without importing Greek categories Scripture doesn't use.

Is this heresy? By the councils' definitions, probably yes. But the councils' definitions aren't Scripture. They're one tradition's attempt to systematize Scripture using Greek philosophy.

**We're asking:** Is there another way?

## The Risk of This Position

We acknowledge the risks:

1. **Historical isolation.** Nearly all Christian traditions affirm Nicene Trinitarianism. Questioning it places us outside the mainstream.

2. **Slippery slope.** If we question the Spirit's personhood, what's next? (We respond: The biblical data for Christ's deity is stronger and different. We follow the evidence.)

3. **Arrogance.** Who are we to question 1,600 years of consensus? (We respond: The Reformers questioned 1,500 years of consensus on justification. Sola Scriptura means Scripture judges tradition, not vice versa.)

4. **Division.** This position may exclude us from fellowship with those who require Nicene orthodoxy. (We respond: We seek unity in Christ, not in Greek philosophical formulations.)

## Conclusion: Heresy or Faithfulness?

**By the councils' standards:** Yes, this position is likely heretical. It denies (or at least questions) the Spirit's distinct personhood as defined by Constantinople.

**By Scripture's standards:** We believe it is faithful. We affirm everything Scripture affirms about the Spirit:
- The Spirit is God (not a creature)
- The Spirit creates, empowers, indwells, transforms
- The Spirit is holy, life-giving, the agent of new birth
- The Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son

We simply decline to add what Scripture doesn't say: that the Spirit is a "third person" (hypostasis) who receives worship alongside Father and Son.

**The question is:** Which standard is final—the councils or Scripture?

If Scripture, then perhaps the councils answered questions Scripture doesn't ask, using categories Scripture doesn't provide, and reached conclusions Scripture doesn't require.

Perhaps the Hebrew testimony—Father, Son, Spirit of God—is enough.

Perhaps biblical language for biblical testimony is not heresy, but faithfulness.
