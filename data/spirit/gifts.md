The Spirit distributes *charismata* (grace-gifts) to believers for building up the church. But which gifts are still active today?

**Key passages:**
- 1 Corinthians 12: Gifts listed (wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, tongues, interpretation)
- Romans 12:6-8: Gifts of service (prophecy, serving, teaching, exhortation, giving, leading, mercy)
- Ephesians 4:11: Gifted people (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers)

**The cessationist debate:**
- **Cessationism:** Miraculous gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles) ceased with the apostles. We have Scripture now; we don't need ongoing revelation.
- **Continuationism:** All gifts continue today. The Spirit is the same yesterday, today, forever. Why would He withdraw gifts?

The Greek approach: systematic categorization of gifts, debate over which are "sign gifts" that authenticated the apostles vs. "ordinary gifts" that continue.

The Hebrew approach: less concern with taxonomy, more focus on the Spirit's [power](#spirit/power 'Hebrew') and [presence](#spirit/presence 'Hebrew') demonstrated in the community.

# Gifts of the Spirit

The New Testament teaches that the Spirit distributes *charismata* (χαρίσματα, grace-gifts) to believers for the common good. These are abilities, enablements, manifestations of the Spirit's power for building up the church.

But which gifts are still active? Did some cease with the apostles? This is the cessationist-continuationist debate—one of the most divisive questions in Protestant pneumatology.

## The Biblical Lists

The New Testament gives several lists of spiritual gifts. They overlap but are not identical.

### 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 (Nine Gifts)

**1 Corinthians 12:8-10:** "To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of *wisdom*, and to another the utterance of *knowledge* according to the same Spirit, to another *faith* by the same Spirit, to another gifts of *healing* by the one Spirit, to another the working of *miracles*, to another *prophecy*, to another the ability to distinguish between *spirits*, to another various kinds of *tongues*, to another the *interpretation of tongues*."

1. **Utterance of wisdom** (*logos sophias*) - Spiritual insight, application
2. **Utterance of knowledge** (*logos gnōseōs*) - Understanding of truth, revelation
3. **Faith** (*pistis*) - Extraordinary trust, miracle-working faith
4. **Gifts of healing** (*charismata iamatōn*) - Supernatural healing
5. **Working of miracles** (*energēmata dunameōn*) - Demonstrations of power (exorcisms, nature miracles)
6. **Prophecy** (*prophēteia*) - Speaking God's word, inspired utterance
7. **Distinguishing between spirits** (*diakriseis pneumatōn*) - Discerning true vs. false spirits
8. **Tongues** (*genē glōssōn*) - Speaking in unknown languages
9. **Interpretation of tongues** (*hermēneia glōssōn*) - Translating the unknown language

**Pattern:** These are mostly *miraculous, revelatory* gifts. They demonstrate the Spirit's supernatural power.

### Romans 12:6-8 (Seven Gifts)

**Romans 12:6-8:** "Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if *prophecy*, in proportion to our faith; if *service*, in our serving; the one who *teaches*, in his teaching; the one who *exhorts*, in his exhortation; the one who *contributes*, in generosity; the one who *leads*, with zeal; the one who does acts of *mercy*, with cheerfulness."

1. **Prophecy** (*prophēteia*)
2. **Service** (*diakonia*) - Practical ministry, helps
3. **Teaching** (*didaskalia*) - Instruction in truth
4. **Exhortation** (*paraklēsis*) - Encouragement, comforting
5. **Contributing** (*metadidous*) - Generosity, giving
6. **Leading** (*proistamenos*) - Leadership, administration
7. **Acts of mercy** (*eleōn*) - Compassion, caring for the suffering

**Pattern:** These are mostly *practical, service-oriented* gifts. Less miraculous, more relational and functional.

### Ephesians 4:11 (Five Offices)

**Ephesians 4:11:** "He gave the *apostles*, the *prophets*, the *evangelists*, the *shepherds* and *teachers*."

1. **Apostles** (*apostoloi*) - Sent ones, church planters, authoritative messengers
2. **Prophets** (*prophētai*) - Inspired speakers, revealers of God's word
3. **Evangelists** (*euangelistai*) - Gospel proclaimers
4. **Shepherds** (*poimenas*) - Pastors, overseers of congregations
5. **Teachers** (*didaskaloi*) - Instructors in doctrine

**Pattern:** These are *people* gifted for leadership, not abilities. The Spirit gives gifted individuals to the church.

### Other Passages

**1 Corinthians 12:28:** "God has appointed in the church first *apostles*, second *prophets*, third *teachers*, then *miracles*, then *gifts of healing*, *helping*, *administrating*, and *various kinds of tongues*."

**1 Peter 4:10-11:** "As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace: whoever *speaks*, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever *serves*, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies."

Speaking and serving—two broad categories.

## The Nature of Gifts

### Charismata: Grace Gifts

The Greek word *charisma* (χάρισμα) comes from *charis* (χάρις), "grace." Spiritual gifts are *grace-gifts*—unearned, freely given by God's favor.

**1 Corinthians 12:11:** "All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to *each one individually as He wills*."

- Gifts are *sovereign* - the Spirit decides who gets what, not us
- Gifts are *individual* - each believer receives gifts
- Gifts are *distributed* - not everyone has the same gift

**Key principle:** Gifts are not merit badges. You didn't earn them. You don't deserve them. The Spirit gives them by grace.

### For the Common Good

**1 Corinthians 12:7:** "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit *for the common good*."

Gifts are not for personal status or enjoyment. They're *for the church*. Every gift exists to build up the body of Christ.

**Ephesians 4:12:** Christ gave gifted people "to equip the saints for the work of ministry, *for building up the body of Christ*."

The purpose of gifts: edification, unity, maturity.

**1 Corinthians 14:26:** "When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. *Let all things be done for building up*."

The test: Does this build up the church? If not, don't use it.

### Love > Gifts

**1 Corinthians 13** interrupts the discussion of gifts to say: *Love is greater.*

**1 Corinthians 13:1-3:** "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing."

Gifts without love = nothing. You can prophesy, heal, speak in tongues—but if you lack love, it's worthless.

**1 Corinthians 13:8:** "Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away."

Gifts are temporary. Love is eternal. Pursue love first.

## The Cessationist-Continuationist Debate

The central question: Did some gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles) cease with the apostles, or do all gifts continue today?

### Cessationism: Miraculous Gifts Have Ceased

**The argument:**

1. **Apostolic authentication:** Miraculous gifts were "signs of an apostle" (2 Corinthians 12:12). They authenticated the apostles' message in the absence of the completed New Testament. Once Scripture was complete, the sign-gifts ceased.

2. **1 Corinthians 13:8-10:** "As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but *when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away*." The "perfect" is the completed canon of Scripture. When the New Testament was finished, partial revelation (prophecy, tongues, knowledge) ceased.

3. **Church history:** The early church fathers (after the apostolic age) rarely mention tongues, prophecy, or miracles. The gifts seem to have faded by the 2nd-3rd centuries. This confirms they were temporary.

4. **The sufficiency of Scripture:** We have the completed Bible. We don't need ongoing revelation (prophecy, tongues with interpretation). To claim new revelation risks adding to Scripture, which is forbidden (Revelation 22:18-19).

5. **Abuse and confusion:** Modern charismatic claims (tongues, prophecy, miracles) often involve error, emotionalism, or outright fraud. True miraculous gifts would be undeniable (like the apostles'). The fact that modern "gifts" are debatable suggests they're not the real thing.

**Cessationist conclusion:** The "ordinary" gifts (teaching, service, mercy, administration, giving) continue. The "extraordinary" gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles) ceased with the apostles or the closing of the canon.

### Continuationism: All Gifts Continue Today

**The argument:**

1. **No biblical text says gifts ceased:** There is no verse that says, "Tongues will stop in AD 95" or "Prophecy will cease when the canon closes." Cessationism reads this into 1 Corinthians 13:10, but "the perfect" more likely refers to Christ's return (when we see "face to face," 13:12), not the completed Bible.

2. **Joel 2:28-29:** "I will pour out My Spirit on *all flesh*... in those days I will pour out My Spirit." Peter says this was fulfilled at Pentecost (Acts 2:16-21). "Those days" are the entire church age, until Christ returns. The Spirit's outpouring—including prophecy, visions, dreams—is for the whole new covenant era, not just the apostles.

3. **1 Corinthians 1:7:** "You are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ." Gifts are given *until Christ returns*, not until the canon closes.

4. **Ephesians 4:11-13:** Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers "until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood." We haven't reached that yet. Therefore, the gifts (including prophets) continue.

5. **Church history is mixed:** While the post-apostolic fathers mention miracles less, they don't deny them. Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen all claim miraculous gifts continued. The decline may reflect spiritual decline, not theological cessation.

6. **Modern testimony:** Millions of Christians worldwide testify to experiencing tongues, prophecy, healing, and miracles. While some claims are fraudulent, others are credible. Dismissing all modern testimony is arrogant.

7. **The Spirit is the same:** "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8). If the Spirit gave miraculous gifts in the 1st century, why would He stop? God hasn't changed.

**Continuationist conclusion:** All gifts—including tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles—continue today. Believers should earnestly desire them (1 Corinthians 14:1, "Earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy").

### The Middle Ground: "Open but Cautious"

Some hold a third position:
- Gifts *can* continue (God is sovereign, He can give them if He chooses)
- But we shouldn't *expect* them with the same frequency or intensity as the apostolic age
- Be open to God's work, but test everything (1 Thessalonians 5:21, "Test everything; hold fast what is good")

This avoids dogmatism on either side while remaining biblically grounded.

## Specific Gifts: Examination

### Tongues

**What is it?**
- Speaking in a language unknown to the speaker
- Can be human languages (Acts 2:4-11, the apostles spoke in known foreign languages) or angelic/heavenly languages (1 Corinthians 13:1, "tongues of men and of angels")

**Purpose:**
- **Sign to unbelievers:** 1 Corinthians 14:22, "Tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers"
- **Personal edification:** 1 Corinthians 14:4, "The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself"
- **Prayer and worship:** 1 Corinthians 14:14-15, "If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays"

**Regulations:**
- Must be interpreted in public worship (1 Corinthians 14:27-28)
- Limited use (two or three at most, one at a time)
- If no interpreter, remain silent (1 Corinthians 14:28)

**Cessationist view:** Tongues ceased when the last apostle died (or when the canon closed). Modern "tongues" are either learned gibberish, psychological phenomena, or demonic counterfeits.

**Continuationist view:** Tongues continue as a gift for private prayer and, with interpretation, for public worship. Pentecostal and charismatic Christians practice tongues widely.

### Prophecy

**What is it?**
- Speaking God's message, inspired by the Spirit
- Can be foretelling (predicting future events) or forthtelling (declaring God's truth)

**Old Testament prophecy:**
- Authoritative, "Thus says the Lord"
- Equal to Scripture (the prophets wrote Scripture)
- Infallible

**New Testament prophecy:**
- Less authoritative than apostolic teaching (1 Corinthians 14:29, "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others *weigh what is said*")
- Fallible (can be tested, corrected, rejected)
- For edification, encouragement, consolation (1 Corinthians 14:3)

**Cessationist view:** Prophecy ceased with the apostles. The completed Bible is sufficient. Modern "prophecy" is just application of Scripture, not new revelation.

**Continuationist view:** Prophecy continues, but it's not infallible like Scripture. It's Spirit-inspired insight, encouragement, warning—always subject to testing by Scripture.

### Healing

**What is it?**
- Supernatural cure of sickness or injury through prayer and the Spirit's power

**Old Testament examples:** Elijah, Elisha
**Jesus' ministry:** Constant healing (Matthew 4:23, "He went throughout all Galilee... healing every disease and every affliction")
**Apostolic ministry:** Peter, Paul, others healed the sick (Acts 3:6-7, 5:15-16, 19:11-12)

**Cessationist view:** Miraculous healing ceased with the apostles. God still heals in answer to prayer, but not through a "gift of healing" bestowed on individuals.

**Continuationist view:** The gift of healing continues. Some believers have a special gifting for healing prayer. God still works miracles.

**The tension:** Why do some heal and others don't? Why do gifted "healers" sometimes fail? Is it lack of faith, God's sovereign will, or false claims?

### Miracles

**What is it?**
- Supernatural acts defying natural law (raising the dead, exorcisms, controlling nature)

**Cessationist view:** Ceased with the apostles. Miracles authenticated the gospel in the absence of Scripture. Now we have the Bible.

**Continuationist view:** Miracles continue, especially in pioneer missions where the gospel is first preached. Testimonies from missionaries in unreached areas report miracles.

## The Practical Question: Should We Seek Gifts?

**1 Corinthians 14:1:** "Earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy."

Paul commands us to *desire* gifts. Not passively wait, but actively *seek*.

**1 Corinthians 12:31:** "Earnestly desire the higher gifts."

Again, *desire* them.

**But also:** Don't obsess over gifts. Focus on love (1 Corinthians 13). Serve with whatever gift you have (1 Peter 4:10). Build up the church (1 Corinthians 14:26).

### If You're Cessationist:

Seek the "ordinary" gifts—teaching, serving, giving, leading, mercy. Don't expect tongues or prophecy. Use Scripture to discern truth.

### If You're Continuationist:

Ask God for gifts. Pray for the sick. Be open to prophecy (and test it). Pursue love above all.

### Either Way:

- **Use your gifts:** Whatever the Spirit has given you, use it for the common good (1 Corinthians 12:7)
- **Love is greater:** Gifts without love = nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1-3)
- **Build up the church:** The test of any gift is edification (1 Corinthians 14:26)

## The Hebrew vs. Greek Tension

### Greek Approach: Systematic Categorization

Classical theology loves to categorize:
- Sign gifts vs. service gifts
- Miraculous vs. ordinary
- Temporary vs. permanent
- Apostolic vs. post-apostolic

This creates systems, clarity, boundaries. It also creates division—cessationists vs. continuationists, each claiming biblical authority.

### Hebrew Approach: Functional Focus

Hebrew thought cares less about *taxonomy* and more about *testimony*:
- Does the Spirit empower the community?
- Are people being built up?
- Is God's presence evident?

Rather than debating *which* gifts continue, focus on *whether* the Spirit is at work. If God heals, praise Him. If He doesn't, trust Him. If someone prophesies, test it by Scripture. If it's true, receive it. If false, reject it.

**Less system, more experience.**
**Less debate, more dependence on the Spirit.**

## Conclusion: Gifts for the Body

The Spirit distributes gifts *as He wills* (1 Corinthians 12:11). Our job is not to argue about which gifts are valid, but to *use whatever gifts we have* for the common good.

**Cessationist or continuationist, agree on this:**
- The Spirit empowers believers
- Gifts are for building up the church
- Love is greater than any gift
- Scripture tests all claims

Focus less on what gifts you *don't* have. Focus more on what gifts you *do* have. And use them for God's glory.

"As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace" (1 Peter 4:10).
