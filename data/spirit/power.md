title: Power - The Spirit's Mighty Acts
---
[The Holy Spirit](#spirit/spirit 'Parent')
---
The Spirit as *power*—God's enabling force for mighty acts. The Hebrew approach: *Ruach* empowers for specific tasks, not ontological [personhood](#spirit/person-presence#greek-person 'Greek') but functional enablement.

**Old Testament pattern:**
- Judges: "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon Samson" (Judges 14:6)—superhuman strength
- Kings: "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David" (1 Samuel 16:13)—leadership and wisdom
- Prophets: "I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord" (Micah 3:8)—bold proclamation

**New Testament pattern:**
- Jesus: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me" (Luke 4:18)—Messianic anointing
- Apostles: "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you" (Acts 1:8)—witness and miracles
- Believers: "The kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power" (1 Corinthians 4:20)—demonstrations of the Spirit

Is this a [person](#spirit/person-presence#greek-person 'Greek') empowering, or God's *power* at work? The [Hebrew framework](#spirit/person-presence#ruach 'Hebrew') sees *dunamis* (power) as the Spirit's essence, not His attribute.

# Power: The Spirit's Mighty Acts

The most common Old Testament experience of the Spirit is *power*—God's enabling force for extraordinary acts. Not abstract personhood, but concrete enablement.

## The Hebrew Concept: Ruach as Empowerment

In Hebrew thought, *ruach* (spirit) and *koach* (power, strength) are closely related. When God's *ruach* comes upon someone, they are filled with *koach* to accomplish what they couldn't otherwise do.

### Judges: Power for Deliverance

The book of Judges shows the Spirit's power pattern most clearly:

**Judges 3:10 (Othniel):** "The Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand."

The Spirit *was upon* him (not *in* him permanently). This enabled him to judge and deliver Israel.

**Judges 6:34 (Gideon):** "The Spirit of the Lord *clothed* Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him."

The Hebrew verb *labesha* means "clothed, wrapped." The Spirit is like a garment Gideon puts on—external empowerment for leadership.

**Judges 11:29 (Jephthah):** "Then the Spirit of the Lord was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh... Then Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord gave them into his hand."

Again, Spirit upon = military victory.

**Judges 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14 (Samson):**
- 13:25: "The Spirit of the Lord began to stir him"
- 14:6: "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces"
- 14:19: "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men"
- 15:14: "The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire"

Samson is the clearest example: When the Spirit rushes upon him, he gains *superhuman strength*. Tears a lion apart. Kills thirty men. Breaks ropes like thread.

**This is not personal indwelling. This is raw power.**

### The Pattern: Spirit Comes Upon, Then Departs

The Spirit's empowerment in Judges is *temporary* and *task-specific*:
- The Spirit comes *upon* (not permanently *within*)
- Empowerment is for a specific act (battle, leadership, deliverance)
- The Spirit can depart when the task is done

**1 Samuel 16:13-14:** "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed [David] in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward... Now the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the Lord tormented him."

David receives the Spirit; Saul loses it. The Spirit's presence is *not permanent*. It's given for kingship, withdrawn when the king is rejected.

**This is fundamentally different from New Testament indwelling** (Romans 8:9, "Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Him"—permanent, not temporary).

### Power for Prophecy

The Spirit's power isn't just physical—it enables *speech*.

**Numbers 11:25:** "Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to [Moses], and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied."

The Spirit is *transferable*—taken from Moses and distributed to the seventy. When it rests on them, they prophesy (speak God's words).

**1 Samuel 10:6, 10:** Samuel tells Saul, "The Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man... When they came to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them."

Saul, empowered by the Spirit, prophesies. This is ecstatic speech, inspired by divine power.

**2 Peter 1:21:** "No prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."

The Spirit *carries* prophets. The metaphor is wind filling a sail—the prophet is moved by external power, not internal will.

### Power for Wisdom and Skill

The Spirit empowers not just mighty acts and prophecy, but *skill* and *wisdom*.

**Exodus 31:3 (Bezalel):** "I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship, to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze."

Bezalel builds the Tabernacle. God fills him with the Spirit—not for miracles or prophecy, but for *craftsmanship*. The Spirit gives skill in art, design, metalwork.

**Isaiah 11:2 (Messiah):** "The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord."

The Messiah is empowered by the Spirit for wisdom, counsel, might. The Spirit is the source of these capacities.

**Daniel 5:11-12:** The queen describes Daniel as one "in whom is the spirit of the holy gods" (*ruach elahin qaddishin*)—meaning he has divine wisdom and insight.

## Greek Categories: Power as Attribute

Greek theology asks: If the Spirit has power, the Spirit must be *someone* who has power. Power is an attribute, and attributes belong to persons.

### The Systematic Argument

**Premise 1:** Only persons have attributes (power, wisdom, love)
**Premise 2:** The Spirit has power (Acts 1:8, Romans 15:13)
**Conclusion:** The Spirit is a person

**1 Corinthians 12:11:** "All these [gifts] are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually *as He wills*."

"As He wills"—this is volitional agency. The Spirit decides, chooses, distributes. Only a person has will.

**Acts 1:8:** "You will receive *power* (*dunamis*) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."

The Spirit gives power—but classical theology insists the Spirit *is not* power. The Spirit is a person who *has* power and *gives* power.

**The distinction:**
- **Hebrew thought:** The Spirit *is* God's power
- **Greek thought:** The Spirit *has* power (as an attribute of His person)

### The Concern: Impersonal Force?

The reason Greek theology resists "Spirit = power" is the fear of reducing the Spirit to an impersonal force—like electricity or magnetism.

**Luke's usage seems to support this concern:**

**Luke 1:35:** "The Holy Spirit (*pneuma hagion*) will come upon you, and the power of the Most High (*dunamis hupsistou*) will overshadow you."

Two parallel phrases:
- Holy Spirit will come upon you
- Power of the Most High will overshadow you

Are these two things, or two ways of saying the same thing?

**Greek theology:** Two things. The Spirit (a person) will come, and power (His attribute) will accompany Him.

**Hebrew theology:** Same thing. The Spirit *is* the power of the Most High. Parallelism, not distinction.

**Acts 10:38:** "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit (*pneuma hagion*) and with power (*dunamis*)."

Again, Spirit *and* power. Distinction or parallelism?

**Greek reading:** Jesus received the Spirit-person, who brought power.
**Hebrew reading:** Jesus was anointed with the Spirit, which is God's power.

## The New Testament: Power for Mission

The New Testament continues the Old Testament pattern: the Spirit empowers for mission.

### Jesus' Ministry: Empowered by the Spirit

**Luke 4:14:** "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit (*dunamis pneuma*) to Galilee."

After the Spirit descends at baptism (Luke 3:22), Jesus ministers *in the power of the Spirit*.

**Luke 4:18-19:** Jesus reads Isaiah 61: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim liberty to the captives..."

This is classic Old Testament anointing. The Spirit *upon* Jesus enables His mission.

**Acts 10:38:** "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him."

Jesus' miracles are attributed to the Spirit's power. The Spirit empowers healing, exorcism, deliverance.

**Matthew 12:28:** "If it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."

Exorcism *by the Spirit*. The Spirit is the *power* by which Jesus acts.

### The Apostles: Power for Witness

**Acts 1:8:** "You will receive power (*dunamis*) when the Holy Spirit (*pneuma hagion*) has come upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."

The pattern repeats: Spirit *comes upon* → power received → mission accomplished.

**Acts 2:1-4:** At Pentecost, "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance."

Power for speech—just like the Old Testament prophets.

**Acts 4:31:** "When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."

Filling → boldness → proclamation. The Spirit empowers witness.

**Acts 6:8:** "Stephen, full of grace and power (*dunamis*), was doing great wonders and signs among the people."

Stephen is "full of the Spirit" (6:5) and therefore full of *power*.

### Signs and Wonders

The Spirit's power is demonstrated in miracles.

**Romans 15:18-19:** Paul says, "I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God."

"Power of signs and wonders" = "power of the Spirit." The Spirit is the *power* that works miracles.

**1 Corinthians 2:4-5:** "My speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power (*pneuma kai dunamis*), so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God."

Again, Spirit *and* power—parallel terms.

**Galatians 3:5:** "Does He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?"

God "supplies the Spirit" and "works miracles." The Spirit is the agent (or instrument) of miraculous power.

### The Spirit as Dunamis

**Romans 15:13:** "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit (*dunamis pneuma hagion*) you may abound in hope."

The Spirit is *the power* by which we abound in hope.

**Ephesians 3:16:** "That according to the riches of His glory He may grant you to be strengthened with power (*dunamis*) through His Spirit in your inner being."

Strengthened *with power* → *through the Spirit*. The Spirit is the means by which power comes.

**2 Timothy 1:7:** "God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power (*dunamis*) and love and self-control."

The "spirit" (probably the Holy Spirit, though possibly human spirit) is characterized by *power*.

## The Tension: Is the Spirit Power, or Does He Give Power?

Here's the central question: Is the Spirit *God's power*, or is the Spirit a *person* who gives power?

### The Case for "Spirit = Power"

**Biblical language often equates them:**
- Luke 1:35: "Holy Spirit" // "power of the Most High"
- Luke 4:14: "power of the Spirit"
- Acts 10:38: "with the Holy Spirit and with power" (hendiadys—one thing described two ways)

**Old Testament pattern:**
- When the Spirit comes upon someone, *power* results
- The Spirit is the *force* that enables acts beyond natural capacity
- Hebrew *ruach* is wind, breath, life-force—not a person but an animating power

**Functional language:**
- The Spirit is *poured out* (Acts 2:17)—like liquid, not a person
- The Spirit *fills* (Acts 2:4)—like a substance filling a container
- The Spirit is *received* (Acts 2:38)—like a gift or power, not a person arriving

**Conclusion:** The Spirit is God's power, God's enabling force, God's life-giving breath. To say "the Spirit empowered me" is to say "God empowered me by His Spirit."

### The Case for "Spirit Gives Power"

**Personal agency:**
- 1 Corinthians 12:11: The Spirit distributes gifts "as He wills"—volitional agency
- Acts 13:2: "The Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul'"—the Spirit speaks, commands
- Acts 16:6-7: The Spirit forbids Paul from going to Asia—active blocking

**Distinction between Spirit and power:**
- Acts 1:8: "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you"—the coming of the Spirit *results in* power, but they're distinct
- Ephesians 3:16: "Strengthened with power *through* His Spirit"—the Spirit is the *means*, power is the *result*

**Relational language:**
- The Spirit testifies (Romans 8:16), intercedes (Romans 8:26), teaches (John 14:26)—personal actions
- You can grieve the Spirit (Ephesians 4:30), lie to the Spirit (Acts 5:3)—personal responses

**Conclusion:** The Spirit is a person who *has* power and *gives* power to believers. The Spirit is not power itself.

### The Hebrew Alternative: Both/And

Maybe the dichotomy is false. Maybe asking "Is the Spirit power or a person?" is a Greek question imposing either/or logic on Hebrew both/and testimony.

**Hebrew thought is comfortable with paradox:**
- God's Word is both *something God speaks* and *someone who becomes flesh* (John 1:1-14)
- God's Wisdom is both *an attribute* and *personified as a woman building her house* (Proverbs 8)
- God's Shekinah is both *God's glory* and described with personal verbs ("departed," "dwelt," "wept")

**Could the Spirit function the same way?**
- The Spirit *is* God's power (functional reality)
- The Spirit *is described* using personal language (literary device)
- We don't need to choose—we testify to both

**When the Spirit empowers, it's God empowering.** The Spirit is not a separate person channeling power—the Spirit *is* the power of God at work.

But we use personal language because God is personal, and His power is not mechanical—it's relational, purposeful, loving.

## Practical Implications: Power for the Christian Life

Whether the Spirit is *a person who gives power* or *God's power described personally*, the practical reality is the same: **We need the Spirit's power.**

### Power to Witness

**Acts 1:8:** "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be My witnesses."

Christian witness is not human persuasion—it's empowered proclamation. The Spirit gives boldness, clarity, conviction.

**1 Thessalonians 1:5:** "Our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction."

Effective evangelism requires the Spirit's power. Without it, we have words but no impact.

### Power for Holiness

**Romans 8:13:** "If you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."

Sanctification is *by the Spirit*. We cannot kill sin by willpower alone—we need the Spirit's power to overcome the flesh.

**Galatians 5:16:** "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

Walking by the Spirit means *depending on His power* to resist temptation.

### Power for Ministry

**1 Corinthians 12:4-11:** The Spirit distributes gifts—prophecy, healing, miracles, tongues—*as He wills*.

Ministry effectiveness comes from the Spirit's empowerment, not natural talent.

**2 Corinthians 3:5-6:** "Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit."

We are insufficient; the Spirit makes us sufficient. Power for ministry is *from the Spirit*.

### Power for Suffering

**Romans 8:26:** "The Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."

In weakness, the Spirit empowers prayer. When we can't find words, the Spirit prays for us.

**Acts 7:55:** Stephen, full of the Spirit, sees the glory of God while being stoned—power to endure persecution with faith.

## Conclusion: The Spirit as God's Power

The overwhelming biblical testimony is that the Spirit is *power*—God's enabling, transforming, empowering force.

**Old Testament:** The Spirit rushes upon judges, rests on prophets, fills craftsmen—enabling acts beyond natural capacity.

**New Testament:** The Spirit empowers Jesus' miracles, the apostles' witness, the church's mission, believers' holiness.

**The question:** Is this power *a person* (Greek), or is it *God's power described personally* (Hebrew)?

**Classical theology insists:** Person. The Spirit has will, speaks, can be grieved—therefore personal.

**Hebrew critique asks:** Or is this metaphorical language for God's activity, like Wisdom's "call" and the Word's "going forth"?

**The practical reality:** Whether person or personified power, we need the Spirit. Without the Spirit's enabling, we cannot witness, cannot be holy, cannot minister, cannot endure.

**The power of God.** Given by the Spirit. Or: the Spirit, who is God's power. Either way, we depend entirely on Him.

"Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts" (Zechariah 4:6).
