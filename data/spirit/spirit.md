The *Third Person* of the Trinity.

Key questions:
- *Person or Power?* - Is the Spirit a person or God's active force?
- *Indwelling* - Does the Spirit live in believers today?
- *Gifts* - Are miraculous gifts still active?
- *Baptism* - What is baptism in the Spirit?
- *Fruit* - How does the Spirit transform us?

The Hebrew approach: *Ruach* - breath, wind, life-force moving in the world.
The Greek approach: Categorizing the Spirit's nature, roles, and operations.
