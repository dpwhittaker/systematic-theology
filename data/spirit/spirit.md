The **Spirit of God**—*Ruach Elohim*, *Ruach HaKodesh*. God's breath, presence, power in the world.

**Biblical descriptions:**
- [*Ruach* - breath, wind, life](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew') - God's animating force, the Hebrew testimony
- [*Presence* dwelling with us](#spirit/presence 'Hebrew') - Shekinah, God with His people
- [*Indwelling* believers today](#spirit/indwelling 'Drill') - The Spirit dwells in us
- [*Baptism* in the Spirit](#spirit/baptism-spirit 'Drill') - One event or ongoing reality?
- [*Gifts* of power](#spirit/gifts 'Drill') - Miraculous charismata, cessationism debate
- [*Fruit* of character](#spirit/fruit 'Drill') - Galatians 5, transformation over time

**The fundamental question:** Does the [Greek formulation](#spirit/person 'Greek') ("third person of the Trinity") illuminate or obscure Scripture's testimony about the Spirit of God? This question raises issues of [historical heresy](#spirit/heresy 'Greek')—we address those charges directly.

**The biblical pattern:**
- The **Father** is worshipped throughout Scripture
- The **Son** filled with the Spirit is worshipped (the Father is pleased)
- The **Spirit of God** empowers, fills, indwells—but is never commanded as object of worship

[Hebrew approach](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew'): Ruach HaKodesh as *God's active presence*—breath, wind, life-force, prophetic inspiration. Jewish sources speak of Ruach HaKodesh as God's activity, not a separate "person."

**The question:** Does Greek "three persons, one substance" language illuminate this biblical pattern, or import pagan categories that obscure the testimony? Father, Son, Spirit of God—relational and functional terms—may be sufficient.
