The Spirit of God. But *what* is He?

**Key tensions:**
- [*Person* or *Power*?](#spirit/person 'Greek') - Third person of the Trinity, or God's active presence?
- [*Ruach* - breath, wind, life](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew') - The Hebrew approach: God's animating force
- [*Presence* dwelling with us](#spirit/presence 'Hebrew') - Shekinah, God with His people
- [*Indwelling* believers today](#spirit/indwelling 'Drill') - Does He live in us permanently?
- [*Baptism* in the Spirit](#spirit/baptism-spirit 'Drill') - One event or ongoing reality?
- [*Gifts* of power](#spirit/gifts 'Greek') - Miraculous charismata, cessationism debate
- [*Fruit* of character](#spirit/fruit 'Drill') - Galatians 5, transformation over time

**The fundamental question:** Is the Spirit *someone* distinct from God, or is He *God's power* active in the world?

[Greek approach](#spirit/person 'Greek'): Systematic categorization - the Spirit as third *person* of the Trinity, with distinct attributes, roles, procession.

[Hebrew approach](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew'): Ruach HaKodesh as *God's presence*, not a separate person - breath, wind, life-force, prophetic inspiration.

Jewish sources explicitly deny the Spirit as a distinct person. The Talmud speaks of Ruach HaKodesh as prophetic inspiration that "departed from Israel" after the last prophets - not a divine person, but God's activity.

Does Trinitarian doctrine preserve biblical revelation or impose Greek ontology onto Hebrew testimony?
