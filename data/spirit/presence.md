title: Presence - God With Us

[The Holy Spirit](#spirit/spirit 'Parent')
---
The Spirit as *presence*—God dwelling with His people. In Hebrew thought, the *Shekinah* (God's glory dwelling) and [*Ruach HaKodesh*](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew') both speak of God's nearness, not a separate [person](#spirit/person 'Greek').

**Old Testament pattern:**
- Tabernacle: "The cloud covered the tent, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" (Exodus 40:34)
- Temple: "The glory of the Lord filled the house of God" (2 Chronicles 5:14)
- Exile: "The glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city" (Ezekiel 11:23)

**New Testament fulfillment:**
- Believers are the temple: "You are God's temple, and God's Spirit dwells in you" (1 Corinthians 3:16)
- God's [indwelling](#spirit/indwelling 'Drill') presence through the Spirit

Is this a third person taking up residence, or *God Himself* dwelling with us?

# Presence: God With Us

The greatest promise in Scripture is not about what God gives, but about God Himself: **"I will dwell among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people"** (2 Corinthians 6:16, quoting Leviticus 26:12).

This is the story of the Spirit: God's presence dwelling with His people.

## Shekinah: The Dwelling Glory

The Hebrew word *Shekinah* (שכינה) comes from the root *shakan* (שכן), meaning "to dwell, to settle, to tabernacle." It's not a biblical word—it's a rabbinic term developed to speak of God's manifest presence in creation.

**What is the Shekinah?**

In rabbinic Judaism, the Shekinah is:
- God's visible glory
- God's dwelling presence among His people
- The cloud and fire that filled the Tabernacle and Temple
- God's immanent presence, as opposed to His transcendence

The Shekinah is not a separate being or person. It's *God* present in a specific place, with His people.

### The Shekinah in the Tabernacle

**Exodus 25:8:** "Let them make Me a sanctuary (*mikdash*), that I may dwell (*shakan*) in their midst."

God commands Israel to build a Tabernacle so He can *dwell* (*shakan*) among them. This is not symbolic—it's real presence.

**Exodus 40:34-35:** "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord (*kavod YHWH*) filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled (*shakan*) on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."

When the Tabernacle is completed, God's glory descends. The cloud (representing God's presence) *settles* on the tent. The word is *shakan*—dwelling, tabernacling.

**The glory is so intense Moses cannot enter.** This is not a distant, abstract God. This is God *present*, filling the space, overwhelming human capacity to approach.

**Leviticus 16:2:** God tells Moses, "Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat."

God's presence is dangerous. The Shekinah is holy, consuming, requiring mediation.

### The Shekinah in the Temple

When Solomon builds the Temple, the same pattern repeats:

**1 Kings 8:10-11:** "When the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord (*kavod YHWH*) filled the house of the Lord."

God's glory-presence transfers from the Tabernacle to the Temple. The Shekinah now dwells in Jerusalem, in the Holy of Holies above the Ark of the Covenant.

**2 Chronicles 7:1-2:** "As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord (*kavod YHWH*) filled the temple. And the priests could not enter the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord filled the Lord's house."

Fire and cloud—the visible manifestation of God's presence. The Temple is now God's dwelling place on earth.

### The Shekinah Departs

But Israel sins. They worship idols, violate the covenant, spurn God's law. And God's presence—which came by grace—departs.

**Ezekiel 10:18-19:** "Then the glory of the Lord (*kavod YHWH*) went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim. And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out."

Ezekiel watches in horror as the Shekinah lifts off from the Temple. The glory hovers, reluctant to leave—but finally departs.

**Ezekiel 11:23:** "The glory of the Lord (*kavod YHWH*) went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city."

The Shekinah moves to the Mount of Olives, then leaves entirely. The Temple remains—but it's empty. God's presence is gone.

**This is the greatest tragedy in Israel's history.** Not the destruction of the Temple (that comes later, in 586 BC), but the departure of the glory. Without the Shekinah, the Temple is just a building.

### The Shekinah in Exile

The prophets describe the Shekinah as going into exile *with* Israel:

**Ezekiel 11:16:** "Thus says the Lord God: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary (*mikdash*) to them for a while in the countries where they have gone."

God is a "sanctuary" even in exile. The Shekinah accompanies the exiled people, even though the Temple is empty.

**Rabbinic tradition** expands this idea: When Israel suffers, the Shekinah suffers with them. When Israel is in bondage, the Shekinah is in bondage. God's presence is not abstract transcendence—it's intimate solidarity.

**Lamentations 2:9:** "Her king and princes are among the nations; the law is no more, and her prophets find no vision from the Lord."

No vision. No prophecy. The prophetic Ruach HaKodesh has departed along with the Shekinah.

**Talmud Sotah 48b:** "After the last prophets died, the Holy Spirit departed from Israel."

The loss of the Shekinah = the loss of the Spirit = the end of prophecy. These are all ways of describing the same reality: **God's presence has withdrawn.**

### The Hope: Shekinah Will Return

The prophets promise that the Shekinah will return when the Messiah comes:

**Ezekiel 37:26-27:** "I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary (*mikdash*) in their midst forevermore. My dwelling place (*mishkan*) shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."

The Shekinah will return. God will dwell (*shakan*) with His people again. The sanctuary will be restored.

**Ezekiel 43:2-5:** "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel (*kavod Elohei Israel*) was coming from the east... And the glory of the Lord (*kavod YHWH*) entered the temple by the gate facing east... And behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple."

Ezekiel sees a vision of the Shekinah returning from the east (the direction it departed), entering the Temple, filling it once again.

**This is the hope:** God will come back. The glory will return. God's presence will dwell with His people.

## The Spirit as God's Presence

The Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) and the Shekinah are closely related in Hebrew thought. Both refer to *God's presence*.

**Psalm 139:7:** "Where shall I go from Your Spirit (*ruach*)? Or where shall I flee from Your presence (*paneka*, lit. 'Your face')?"

Spirit and presence are parallel. To flee the Spirit is to flee God's presence. They're not two separate things—the Spirit *is* God's presence.

**Isaiah 63:10-11:** "They rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit (*ruach kodesh*); therefore He turned to be their enemy... Then He remembered the days of old, of Moses and His people. Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who put in the midst of them His Holy Spirit (*ruach kodesh*)?"

Israel grieved the Holy Spirit—meaning they drove away God's presence by their rebellion. The Spirit "in their midst" is the same as God dwelling among them.

**Haggai 2:5:** "My Spirit (*ruach*) remains in your midst. Fear not."

After the exile, the returned remnant rebuilds the Temple. But where is the Shekinah? There's no cloud, no fire, no visible glory. The Second Temple is empty.

But God promises: "My Spirit remains in your midst." Even without the visible Shekinah, God's presence is still with His people.

**The Spirit is not a separate person alongside God. The Spirit is God present.**

## The New Testament: Shekinah Fulfilled

The New Testament announces the stunning fulfillment: The Shekinah has returned—not in a building, but in a person.

### Jesus as the Shekinah

**John 1:14:** "The Word became flesh and *tabernacled* (*eskēnōsen*) among us, and we have seen His glory (*doxa*), glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."

The Greek word *eskēnōsen* is the verb form of *skēnē* (tent, tabernacle). It's a direct echo of the Shekinah (*shakan*).

**Jesus tabernacled among us.** The glory that filled the Tabernacle and Temple now dwells in human flesh. The Shekinah has returned—in Jesus.

**John continues:** "We have seen His *glory* (*doxa*)." This is Exodus 40:34 language—the *kavod YHWH* (glory of the Lord). The disciples see in Jesus what Moses saw in the cloud: God's presence.

**John 2:19-21:** "Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.' The Jews then said, 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?' But He was speaking about the temple of His body."

Jesus *is* the Temple. The place where God dwells is not a building in Jerusalem—it's Jesus' body. The Shekinah is in Him.

**Matthew 17:2, 5:** At the Transfiguration, "His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became white as light... A bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, 'This is My beloved Son.'"

The cloud—the Shekinah—appears again. God's presence is manifest in Jesus. Peter, James, and John see the glory.

**Colossians 2:9:** "In Him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily."

The fullness of God's presence—the Shekinah, the Spirit, the glory—dwells in Jesus. He is Immanuel, "God with us" (Matthew 1:23).

### The Church as the Temple

But Jesus ascends. Does the Shekinah leave again?

No. It *spreads*. From one body to many.

**1 Corinthians 3:16:** "Do you not know that you are God's temple (*naos theou*) and that God's Spirit (*pneuma theou*) dwells (*oikei*) in you?"

The Shekinah now dwells in *believers*. The Spirit—God's presence—lives in the church.

**1 Corinthians 6:19:** "Do you not know that your body is a temple (*naos*) of the Holy Spirit (*pneuma hagion*) within you, whom you have from God?"

Each believer is a temple. The glory that filled the Tabernacle now fills individual hearts.

**Ephesians 2:21-22:** "In [Christ] the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple (*naos*) in the Lord. In Him you also are being built together into a dwelling place (*katoikētērion*) for God by the Spirit (*pneuma*)."

The church is the new Temple. God dwells in it by the Spirit.

**2 Corinthians 6:16:** "We are the temple (*naos*) of the living God; as God said, 'I will dwell (*enoikēsō*) in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.'"

This quotes Leviticus 26:12—the Tabernacle promise. God said He would dwell among His people. Now He does—in the church, by the Spirit.

### Pentecost: The Spirit Poured Out

**Acts 2:2-4:** "Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit."

**Wind and fire.** The same signs that accompanied the Shekinah:
- Wind (breath, *ruach*)
- Fire (the consuming glory of God)

The Shekinah descends at Pentecost—not on a building, but on *people*. The presence that filled the Tabernacle now fills the disciples.

**Acts 2:16-18:** Peter quotes Joel 2:28: "I will pour out My Spirit (*pneuma*) on all flesh."

The promise of the prophets is fulfilled. The Spirit—God's presence—is poured out on all who believe.

## The Spirit as Indwelling Presence

The most profound aspect of New Testament pneumatology is *indwelling*: God's presence lives *within* believers.

### Old Testament vs. New Testament

**Old Testament pattern:**
- The Spirit came *upon* select individuals (judges, kings, prophets)
- Empowerment was temporary and task-specific
- The Spirit could be withdrawn (1 Samuel 16:14, "The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul")

**New Testament pattern:**
- The Spirit dwells *within* all believers (Romans 8:9)
- Presence is permanent and relational
- The Spirit is given as a seal, guarantee, down payment (Ephesians 1:13-14)

**Romans 8:9-11:** "You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells (*oikei*) in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Him. But if Christ is in you... If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells (*oikei*) in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells (*enoikountos*) in you."

The Spirit *dwells* in believers. The verb *oikeō* means "to live, to reside, to make one's home." This is not temporary empowerment—it's permanent residency.

**John 14:16-17:** Jesus promises, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper (*paraklētos*), to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. You know Him, for He dwells (*menei*) with you and will be *in* (*en*) you."

The shift: The Spirit was *with* the disciples (in Jesus). Soon the Spirit will be *in* them (indwelling).

**Ephesians 1:13-14:** "In [Christ] you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in Him, were sealed (*esphragisthēte*) with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee (*arrabōn*) of our inheritance."

The Spirit is a *seal* (mark of ownership) and a *guarantee* (down payment, pledge of future fulfillment). God's presence in us *now* guarantees our future glorification.

### What Does Indwelling Mean?

When we say "the Spirit dwells in believers," what are we claiming?

**Greek theology's answer:** The third person of the Trinity takes up permanent residence in the believer's soul. A divine person lives inside you.

**Hebrew theology's answer:** God's presence is with you. The living God, who filled the Tabernacle and dwelt in Jesus, now lives in you by His Spirit. The Spirit is not *someone else*—it's *God* with you.

The difference:
- **Greek:** Three persons (Father, Son, Spirit). The Spirit-person indwells you, distinct from the Father and Son.
- **Hebrew:** One God. God's presence (called Spirit) dwells in you. When the Spirit is in you, *God* is in you.

**Romans 8:9-11 again:** Notice the interchangeability:
- "The Spirit of God dwells in you"
- "The Spirit of Christ"
- "Christ is in you"
- "The Spirit of Him who raised Jesus"

Are these four different persons? Or four ways of describing *God's indwelling presence*?

**Colossians 1:27:** "Christ in you, the hope of glory."

**Galatians 2:20:** "It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."

**Ephesians 3:17:** "That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith."

The New Testament freely switches between "Christ in you" and "the Spirit in you." Why? Because they're not two separate residents. The Spirit is *God's presence*, and Christ is God incarnate. To have the Spirit is to have Christ, to have God.

### The Temple Metaphor

**1 Corinthians 6:19:** "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit."

A temple is where God's presence dwells. In the Old Testament, God's Shekinah filled the Tabernacle/Temple. In the New Testament, God's Spirit fills believers.

**The parallel is exact:**
- Tabernacle = believer's body
- Shekinah = Holy Spirit
- God dwelling in the Tabernacle = God dwelling in you

The Spirit as indwelling presence is the continuation of the Shekinah story. God said, "I will dwell among My people." First in a tent, then a building, then in Jesus, now in us.

## The Tension: Person or Presence?

So is the indwelling Spirit a distinct *person* living in you, or is it God's *presence* with you?

### The Case for Person

**The Spirit does personal things:**
- Intercedes (Romans 8:26)
- Teaches (John 14:26)
- Guides (John 16:13)
- Testifies (John 15:26)
- Can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30)

You can't grieve a force. The Spirit must be *someone*, not just *something*.

**The Spirit is distinct from the Father and Son:**
- The Father sends the Spirit (John 14:26)
- The Son sends the Spirit (John 15:26)
- The Spirit glorifies the Son (John 16:14)

These are relational verbs. Persons relate to persons.

**Conclusion:** The Spirit is a distinct person, the third member of the Trinity, who indwells believers.

### The Case for Presence

**The Spirit is God's presence:**
- "Where shall I go from Your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from Your presence?" (Psalm 139:7)—Spirit and presence are parallel
- "The Lord is the Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3:17)—identity, not distinction
- To have the Spirit is to have God (Romans 8:9-11)

**The Spirit uses metaphors common to God's attributes:**
- Wisdom is personified (Proverbs 8)—not a person, but a literary device
- The Word "goes forth" (Isaiah 55:11)—not a person, but God's will enacted
- The Shekinah "departed" (Ezekiel 11:23)—not a person, but God's presence withdrawing

**Personal language doesn't require personhood.** It's how Hebrew speaks of God's activity.

**Conclusion:** The Spirit is God's presence, described using personal metaphors, but not a distinct person.

### The Unresolved Tension

Which is it?

**Classical theology says:** Person. The Spirit is the third hypostasis of the Trinity, fully God, distinct from the Father and Son.

**Hebrew critique asks:** Is that necessary? Or can we confess the Spirit's deity and intimacy without multiplying persons?

When the Spirit dwells in you, is it:
- **Greek answer:** A divine person (the Spirit) taking up residence
- **Hebrew answer:** God Himself present with you by His Spirit

Both affirm God's presence. Both affirm the Spirit's deity. But one multiplies persons, the other doesn't.

## Practical Implications

Does this matter for Christian life?

### Prayer and Worship

If the Spirit is a distinct person, we can pray *to* the Spirit, worship the Spirit as we worship the Father and Son.

If the Spirit is God's presence, we pray to *God*, who is present by His Spirit. We worship the one God, known as Father, Son, Spirit.

**Most Christian worship** does the latter. We pray to the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit. We don't typically pray "Holy Spirit, hear my prayer" (though some charismatic traditions do). We pray to God, empowered by the Spirit.

### Assurance and Intimacy

**Romans 8:15-16:** "You have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God."

Is this two persons (the Spirit and my spirit) testifying together? Or is it God's presence within me affirming my sonship?

**The experience is the same either way:** God is with me, testifying that I belong to Him.

**The difference is conceptual, not experiential.**

### Transformation

**2 Corinthians 3:18:** "We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."

Who transforms us? "The Lord who is the Spirit."

**Greek reading:** The Lord (Jesus) and the Spirit work together.
**Hebrew reading:** The Lord *is* the Spirit—God's transforming presence at work in us.

Either way, we confess: God transforms us. The Spirit is God's power making us like Christ.

## Conclusion: Presence, Not Explanation

The Spirit as *presence* is the heart of biblical pneumatology. God is *with* His people. God *dwells* in believers. God's Shekinah, which filled the Tabernacle and Temple, now fills the church.

**The question:** Is this presence a distinct person (the Spirit), or is it God's *mode of being with us* (the Spirit as God's presence)?

**Classical theology says:** Person. You need three persons to be Trinitarian.

**Hebrew theology says:** Presence. You need one God who is with His people.

The lived reality is the same: God is near. God dwells in us. God transforms us. God's presence is our hope.

**Maybe the categories don't matter as much as the reality.**

God is with us. That's the promise. That's the fulfillment. That's the Spirit.

Immanuel. God with us.
