What is "baptism in the Holy Spirit"? Is it conversion, or a second experience after salvation?

**Key texts:**
- Acts 1:5: "You will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now" (Pentecost)
- Acts 2:38: "Repent and be baptized... and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"
- 1 Corinthians 12:13: "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body"

**Three views:**

**1. Pentecostal/Charismatic:** Baptism in the Spirit is a second experience after conversion, evidenced by speaking in tongues. All Christians should seek it.

**2. Reformed/Evangelical:** Baptism in the Spirit *is* conversion. All believers are baptized in the Spirit when they believe (1 Corinthians 12:13). There's no second experience.

**3. Third Way:** The Spirit is received at conversion, but there can be subsequent "fillings" (Ephesians 5:18, "Be filled with the Spirit"—ongoing).

The debate hinges on interpreting Acts (narrative, descriptive) vs. Epistles (didactic, prescriptive). Does Acts describe the normative pattern, or unique transitional events?

# Baptism in the Spirit

Few pneumatological questions generate more heat than this one: What is "baptism in the Holy Spirit"? Is it synonymous with conversion, or is it a distinct, second experience?

The answer divides denominations, shapes worship practices, and determines how Christians understand the Spirit's work.

## The Biblical Texts

### John the Baptist's Prophecy

**Matthew 3:11 // Mark 1:8 // Luke 3:16 // John 1:33:** John the Baptist says, "I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I... *He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit* and fire."

John contrasts his water baptism with Jesus' Spirit baptism. Jesus will immerse people in the Spirit the way John immerses them in water.

**Key question:** Is this a one-time event (Pentecost) or an ongoing reality for all believers?

### Jesus' Promise

**Acts 1:4-5:** Before His ascension, Jesus tells the disciples, "Wait for the promise of the Father, which, He said, you heard from Me; for John baptized with water, but *you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit* not many days from now."

This is fulfilled at Pentecost (Acts 2).

**Acts 1:8:** "You will receive *power* when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be My witnesses."

Baptism in the Spirit = receiving power for witness.

### Pentecost: The First Fulfillment

**Acts 2:1-4:** "When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all *filled with the Holy Spirit* and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance."

**Acts 2:38-39:** Peter preaches, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will *receive the gift of the Holy Spirit*. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to Himself."

The promise: All who repent and believe will receive the Spirit.

### Subsequent "Pentecosts" in Acts

After the initial Pentecost, Acts records several other instances of Spirit-baptism:

**Acts 8:14-17 (Samaritans):** The Samaritans believe Philip's preaching and are baptized. "Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for He had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit."

**Key detail:** They believed and were baptized, *but hadn't received the Spirit yet*. The Spirit came later, when Peter and John laid hands on them.

**Acts 9:17 (Paul):** Ananias says to Paul, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and *be filled with the Holy Spirit*."

Paul is converted on the Damascus road (Acts 9:1-6), but is filled with the Spirit three days later.

**Acts 10:44-47 (Cornelius and the Gentiles):** While Peter is preaching, "the Holy Spirit *fell on* all who heard the word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because *the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles*. For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God."

The Spirit comes *while* Peter is preaching, before water baptism (Acts 10:48).

**Acts 19:1-6 (Ephesian disciples):** Paul finds "disciples" in Ephesus who had only been baptized "into John's baptism." Paul baptizes them "in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, *the Holy Spirit came on them*, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying."

They were "disciples" (believers?) but hadn't received the Spirit. When Paul laid hands on them, the Spirit came, evidenced by tongues and prophecy.

### Paul's Teaching

**1 Corinthians 12:13:** "In one Spirit we were *all baptized into one body*—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and *all were made to drink of one Spirit*."

All Christians have been baptized by/in the Spirit. This is universal—not just some Christians, but *all*.

**Ephesians 4:4-5:** "There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call—one Lord, one faith, *one baptism*."

One baptism. Not two (water and Spirit), but one. Most interpret this as Spirit-baptism, of which water baptism is the sign.

**Ephesians 1:13:** "In Him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in Him, were *sealed with the promised Holy Spirit*."

Believers are sealed with the Spirit at conversion, not in a later experience.

**Ephesians 5:18:** "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but *be filled with the Spirit*."

This is present imperative—ongoing command. "Be being filled" (continuous action). This suggests multiple fillings, not a one-time baptism.

## Three Interpretations

### 1. Pentecostal/Charismatic View: Second Experience

**The argument:**

**Biblical pattern in Acts:**
- Acts 2: Disciples were believers before Pentecost, then baptized in the Spirit
- Acts 8: Samaritans believed and were baptized, *then* received the Spirit (separate experience)
- Acts 9: Paul converted on Damascus road, filled with Spirit three days later
- Acts 19: Ephesian disciples were believers, then received the Spirit with tongues

**Conclusion:** The pattern is clear—salvation (belief, water baptism) *first*, then baptism in the Spirit as a *second* experience.

**Evidence of baptism:** Speaking in tongues. Every time Acts describes Spirit-baptism, tongues are present or implied:
- Acts 2:4: Pentecost—tongues
- Acts 10:46: Cornelius—tongues ("they were hearing them speaking in tongues")
- Acts 19:6: Ephesus—tongues and prophecy
- Acts 8:17: Samaritans—no tongues mentioned, but Simon sees *something* happen (8:18) that makes him want to buy the power. Implication: visible/audible evidence, likely tongues.

**Acts 2:38-39:** "The promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off." If the promise is for all, and the promise is Spirit-baptism with tongues (Acts 2:4), then all Christians should experience it.

**Purpose:** Empowerment for witness (Acts 1:8). You can be saved without being baptized in the Spirit, but you lack power for effective witness until you receive this second blessing.

**Practical application:**
- All believers should *seek* baptism in the Spirit
- Evidence: Speaking in tongues (though some charismatics say tongues are *common* evidence, not *necessary* evidence)
- This is an experience *after* conversion, often received through prayer, laying on of hands, or tarrying

**Classical Pentecostal position:** Baptism in the Spirit is distinct from conversion, evidenced initially by tongues, empowering for service.

### 2. Reformed/Evangelical View: Baptism = Conversion

**The argument:**

**1 Corinthians 12:13:** "*All* were baptized in one Spirit into one body... *all* were made to drink of one Spirit."

All Christians have been baptized in the Spirit. It's not a second experience for some—it's the universal experience of conversion.

**Ephesians 1:13:** Believers are "sealed with the promised Holy Spirit" when they believe, not later.

**Romans 8:9:** "Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Him."

If you belong to Christ, you have the Spirit. Period. There's no category of "saved but not Spirit-baptized." To be in Christ *is* to have the Spirit.

**Acts is descriptive, not prescriptive:**
- Acts records the transition period as the gospel spreads from Jews (Acts 2) to Samaritans (Acts 8) to Gentiles (Acts 10)
- The delays (Samaritans didn't receive the Spirit until apostles came) were *unique* to ensure apostolic oversight and unity in the church
- These are not normative patterns; they're unique transitional events

**Acts 8 example:** Why didn't the Samaritans receive the Spirit immediately? Because God wanted *apostolic witness* to confirm that Samaritans are part of the church. If the Spirit had come without Peter and John, a separate Samaritan church might have formed, divided from the Jerusalem church. The delay was providential, not normative.

**Acts 19 example:** The "disciples" in Ephesus were not Christians yet—they were disciples of John the Baptist who hadn't heard of Jesus. When Paul explained the gospel and baptized them in Jesus' name, *then* they received the Spirit. This is conversion, not a second blessing.

**Tongues in Acts:**
- Tongues appear at key moments (Pentecost, Cornelius, Ephesus) as *signs* confirming the gospel has reached a new group
- Tongues are not presented as the normative evidence of Spirit-baptism elsewhere (1 Corinthians 12:30, "Do all speak with tongues?" Implied answer: No)

**Conclusion:** Spirit-baptism happens at conversion. All believers are baptized in the Spirit when they believe. There's no second experience to seek.

**Practical application:**
- If you've trusted Christ, you have the Spirit
- Don't seek a "second blessing"—you've already been baptized in the Spirit
- Do seek ongoing *filling* (Ephesians 5:18), but that's different from baptism

**Reformed/Evangelical position:** Baptism in the Spirit is conversion. All Christians are baptized in the Spirit at salvation. Subsequent fillings are possible and commanded, but baptism is one-time, at conversion.

### 3. Third Way: One Baptism, Multiple Fillings

Some hold a mediating position:

**Baptism = conversion (one-time):**
- 1 Corinthians 12:13: All believers are baptized in the Spirit at conversion
- This is initiation into the body of Christ

**Filling = ongoing empowerment (repeated):**
- Ephesians 5:18: "Be filled with the Spirit" (present imperative, ongoing command)
- Acts shows repeated fillings: Peter filled at Pentecost (Acts 2:4), filled again in Acts 4:8, the church filled again in Acts 4:31
- Being filled is not a one-time event but an ongoing experience

**Conclusion:** Don't seek "baptism" as a second experience. You were baptized at conversion. But *do* seek repeated fillings—fresh empowerment, renewed passion, deeper dependence on the Spirit.

**This avoids:**
- The Pentecostal error of making tongues normative
- The cessationist error of denying powerful, experiential encounters with the Spirit

**Practical application:**
- If you're a believer, you're baptized in the Spirit (no second experience needed)
- But continually ask God to fill you afresh (Ephesians 5:18)
- Expect the Spirit's power, but don't demand specific signs (tongues, etc.)

**Third way position:** Baptism is at conversion; filling is ongoing and repeatable.

## The Theological Questions

### Is Tongues the Evidence?

**Pentecostal argument:**
- Every time Acts describes Spirit-baptism, tongues appear (Acts 2, 10, 19)
- Therefore, tongues are the *initial evidence* of baptism in the Spirit

**Response:**
- 1 Corinthians 12:30: "Do all speak with tongues?" Paul expects the answer is *no*. Not all have the gift of tongues.
- If tongues are the evidence of Spirit-baptism, and all believers are baptized in the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13), then all should speak in tongues. But Paul says they don't.
- Tongues in Acts may be *signs* for specific occasions (confirming the gospel's spread), not normative evidence for all Spirit-baptism.

### Is Acts Normative or Descriptive?

**The crux of the debate:** Do we pattern our experience after Acts, or do we use the Epistles to interpret Acts?

**Pentecostal hermeneutic:** Acts shows the normal Christian experience. If the early church experienced Spirit-baptism with tongues, we should too.

**Reformed hermeneutic:** Acts describes transitional, unique events. The Epistles (Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians) give us normative theology. Acts illustrates, Epistles instruct.

**Example:**
- Acts shows believers selling possessions and holding all things in common (Acts 2:44-45, 4:32-37)
- Do we make that normative? No—it was unique to the Jerusalem church in a specific context
- Similarly, the pattern in Acts 8 (delayed Spirit-reception) is transitional, not normative

### One Baptism or Two?

**Ephesians 4:5:** "One Lord, one faith, *one baptism*."

If there are two baptisms (water and Spirit), Paul should say "two baptisms." But he says *one*.

**Interpretation 1 (Pentecostal):** The one baptism is Spirit-baptism. Water baptism is the outward sign, Spirit-baptism is the reality.

**Interpretation 2 (Reformed):** The one baptism is Spirit-baptism, which happens at conversion. Water baptism pictures this. There's no second Spirit-baptism later.

**Interpretation 3 (Sacramental):** The one baptism is water baptism, in which the Spirit is given. Baptism conveys the Spirit (baptismal regeneration).

## The Practical Implications

Regardless of your theological position, several practical truths emerge:

### 1. All Believers Have the Spirit

**Romans 8:9:** "If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."

You cannot be a Christian without the Spirit. Conversion and Spirit-reception are inseparable (even if distinct).

### 2. We Need the Spirit's Power

**Acts 1:8:** "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."

Whether you call it baptism, filling, or anointing, we desperately need the Spirit's empowerment for witness, holiness, and ministry.

### 3. We Should Seek Fresh Fillings

**Ephesians 5:18:** "Be filled with the Spirit."

This is a command, present tense. We should continually seek the Spirit's fullness.

**Luke 11:13:** "How much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"

Ask. Seek. Knock. God gives the Spirit to those who ask.

### 4. The Spirit Is Not Controlled by Formula

Pentecost came when they were *waiting* (Acts 1:4, 2:1).
Cornelius received the Spirit while Peter was *preaching* (Acts 10:44).
The Samaritans received through *apostolic laying on of hands* (Acts 8:17).
Paul received through *Ananias laying on hands* (Acts 9:17).
The Ephesians received through *Paul's laying on of hands* (Acts 19:6).

**No single formula.** The Spirit is sovereign. He comes as He wills.

## The Hebrew vs. Greek Tension

### Greek Approach: Systematic Definition

Greek theology wants to *define*:
- What is Spirit-baptism?
- When does it occur?
- What is the evidence?
- Is it one experience or two?

This creates systems, camps, denominations. Pentecostals vs. Reformed vs. charismatics—each with their own systematic explanation.

### Hebrew Approach: Experiential Testimony

Hebrew thought cares less about *system* and more about *experience*:
- Have you encountered God's power?
- Has the Spirit empowered you for witness?
- Are you living in dependence on the Spirit?

Rather than debating *when* you were baptized or *what* the evidence is, the question is: **Is the Spirit at work in your life?**

If yes, praise God. If no, seek Him.

**Less debate, more dependence.**
**Less system, more Spirit.**

## Conclusion: Receive the Spirit

Whatever your theological framework, the biblical command is clear: **Receive the Spirit.**

**Acts 2:38:** "Repent and be baptized... and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

**Luke 11:13:** "How much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"

**Ephesians 5:18:** "Be filled with the Spirit."

Don't get stuck debating *when* or *how*. Focus on *receiving*.

- If you've never trusted Christ, repent and believe. You will receive the Spirit.
- If you're a believer, ask God to fill you afresh. You need the Spirit's power daily.
- If you've experienced the Spirit's power, give thanks. And keep seeking more.

"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!" (Luke 11:13).

Ask. Receive. Be filled.
