How are we *made right* with God? How do we escape [the Fall](#man/fall 'Drill')?

Two approaches to the same rescue:

**Greek approach:** Define the *mechanism* and *stages* of salvation.
- [Justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek'): Forensic declaration—counted righteous by faith alone.
- [Sanctification](#salvation/sanctification 'Greek'): Progressive transformation—growing in holiness.
- [Glorification](#salvation/glorification 'Greek'): Final completion—resurrection body, sin removed forever.
- [Perseverance](#salvation/perseverance 'Greek'): Can you lose it? Eternal security vs. apostasy.
- [Faith](#salvation/faith 'Greek'): Intellectual assent or trust? The instrument of salvation.
- [Grace](#salvation/grace 'Greek'): Unmerited favor—God's gift, not earned by works.
- [Atonement](#jesus/atonement 'Greek'): Theories of how Christ's death saves—penal substitution, satisfaction, moral influence.

**Hebrew approach:** Remember the *pattern* and *relationship* of deliverance.
- [Redemption](#salvation/redemption 'Hebrew'): Exodus pattern—bought back from slavery, the goel who rescues.
- [Return](#salvation/return 'Hebrew'): Teshuva—repentance as coming home, not just remorse.
- [Covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew'): Relationship restored through blood oath, not legal contract.
- [Blood](#salvation/blood 'Hebrew'): Life poured out—seals covenant, covers sin.
- [Faith](#salvation/faith 'Hebrew'): Faithfulness—loyal trust, not mere belief.
- [Grace](#salvation/grace 'Hebrew'): Enabling power—God's presence sustaining, not just forgiveness.

The tension: Is salvation *declared* (forensic) or *lived* (relational)? *Once-for-all* (finished at the cross) or *process* (worked out in time)? *Individual* (personal faith) or *corporate* (family of God)?

Can we be both legally justified and covenantally adopted? Both declared righteous and made righteous? Both saved by grace and called to faithfulness?
