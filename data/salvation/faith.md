title: Faith
---
[Salvation](#salvation/salvation 'Parent')
---
The instrument of salvation—but what is it? Intellectual assent or deep trust? A one-time decision or lifelong faithfulness?

Greek: *Pistis* (πίστις)—belief, faith, trust. In theology, often parsed into three components: knowledge, assent, trust.

Hebrew: *Emunah* (אמונה)—faithfulness, steadfastness, trust. Not just belief *that* something is true, but relational loyalty and trust *in* someone.

The question: Is faith a mental act (believing propositions) or a relational commitment (trusting a person)?

# Faith: Trust in the One Who Saves

"For by [grace](#salvation/grace 'Drill') you have been saved through faith" (Ephesians 2:8).

Faith is the instrument of salvation. We're not saved *by* works, but *by* faith.

But what is faith? How does it work? And can it exist without changing how we live?

## The Meaning of "Faith"

### Hebrew: *Emunah* (אמונה)

**Faithfulness, steadfastness, trust, reliability.**

**Habakkuk 2:4:** "The righteous shall live by his *emunah*."

Often translated "faith," but the root (*aman*) means "to be firm, steady, reliable."

*Emunah* is:
- **God's faithfulness:** He is reliable, trustworthy, keeps covenant.
- **Human trust:** We rely on God's faithfulness.
- **Human faithfulness:** We live loyally in response to His covenant.

**Not just belief that God exists, but trust in His character and loyalty to His covenant.**

**Genesis 15:6:** "Abram believed (*he'emin*, from *aman*) the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness."

Abraham trusted God's promise—not just intellectual belief, but relational confidence that God would do what He said.

### Greek: *Pistis* (πίστις)

**Faith, belief, trust, faithfulness.**

**Romans 3:28:** "For we hold that one is justified by faith (*pistis*) apart from works of the law."

**Hebrews 11:1:** "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."

**In Greek philosophy (Plato, Aristotle):** *Pistis* is inferior to knowledge (*epistēmē*). It's opinion, not certainty.

**In the NT:** *Pistis* is saving trust—not inferior to knowledge, but relational confidence in Christ.

## Three Components of Faith (Traditional Systematic Theology)

Reformed theology typically divides faith into three elements:

### 1. Knowledge (*Notitia*)

**You must know something about God and the gospel.**

**Romans 10:14:** "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?"

You can't believe in Jesus if you've never heard of Him.

**Minimum knowledge required:**
- God exists and is holy.
- I am a sinner.
- Jesus died and rose to save sinners.
- Salvation is by [grace](#salvation/grace 'Greek') through faith.

**Hebrews 11:6:** "Whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."

**Knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient.** Demons have knowledge (James 2:19: "Even the demons believe—and shudder!"), but they don't have saving faith.

### 2. Assent (*Assensus*)

**You must agree that the gospel is true.**

Not just "I've heard about Jesus," but "I believe what I've heard is true."

**James 2:19:** "You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!"

The demons have knowledge and assent (they know God exists and agree it's true), but they don't trust Him.

**Assent is necessary, but not sufficient.**

### 3. Trust (*Fiducia*)

**You must personally rely on Christ for salvation.**

Not just "I know Jesus died" (knowledge) or "I believe He died" (assent), but "I'm trusting Him to save *me*."

**This is the decisive element.** Trust is what makes faith saving.

**Analogy:** You know a chair exists (knowledge). You believe it can hold weight (assent). But you don't truly trust the chair until you sit in it (trust).

**Similarly:** Knowing about Jesus and believing the gospel is true isn't enough. You must *rest* on Him—commit yourself to His mercy.

**Proverbs 3:5:** "Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding."

Trust is leaning your full weight on God.

## Faith as Relational Trust, Not Just Mental Belief

### The Problem with Overemphasizing Assent

**If faith is primarily intellectual (agreeing with propositions), then:**
- Salvation depends on correct theology. (But what about the thief on the cross, who had minimal knowledge?)
- Faith becomes cerebral, not relational.
- Assurance depends on how confident you are in your beliefs.

**James 2:19 exposes this:** Demons have orthodox theology. They know God is one (monotheism). They believe Jesus is the Son of God (Mark 5:7). But they're not saved.

**Why?** They lack trust. They don't *rest* in God's mercy. They don't *commit* to Him.

### Faith as Personal Commitment

**John 1:12:** "But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."

**Receiving Christ** is more than affirming facts. It's welcoming Him, yielding to Him, entrusting yourself to Him.

**John 3:16:** "Whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

**Believing *in* Him** (not just *about* Him). Personal trust, not abstract assent.

**Romans 10:9:** "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

**Confessing Jesus as Lord** means submitting to His authority—relational, not just intellectual.

### The Hebrew Framework: Covenant Trust

In Hebrew thought, faith is covenant faithfulness.

**God is faithful (*emunah*):** He keeps His promises.

**We trust (*emunah*):** We rely on His faithfulness.

**We are faithful (*emunah*):** We live loyally in the covenant relationship.

**All three are connected.** Faith isn't just a one-time mental decision. It's ongoing relational trust and loyalty.

**Hebrews 11 (Hall of Faith):** Lists people who *lived* by faith—Abraham obeyed, Moses chose suffering with God's people, Rahab hid the spies.

**Faith produced action.** Not because works save, but because faith is inherently active. It's trust that shapes life.

## Faith and Works: The Tension

**The Protestant dilemma:**

**Paul:** "We hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law" (Romans 3:28).

**James:** "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone" (James 2:24).

**Are they contradicting each other?**

### Resolution: Different Questions, Same Truth

**Paul's question:** "How are we initially justified before God?" (Answer: Faith alone, not works.)

**James' question:** "What kind of faith justifies?" (Answer: Faith that produces works, not dead faith.)

**Paul combats legalism:** Don't think you earn salvation by obeying the law.

**James combats cheap grace:** Don't think you're saved if your "faith" produces no obedience.

### Living Faith vs. Dead Faith

**James 2:17:** "Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."

**Dead faith:** Intellectual assent without trust or transformation. You say you believe, but your life shows no evidence.

**Living faith:** Trust that results in obedience. You believe, and your actions reflect that trust.

**James 2:18:** "Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."

**Works don't create faith. They prove faith exists.**

**Analogy:** Fire produces heat. No heat = no fire. Heat doesn't create fire, but it proves fire exists.

Similarly: Faith produces works. No works = no genuine faith. Works don't create faith, but they prove faith is real.

### Faith Alone, But Never Alone

**Luther's formula:** "We are justified by faith alone, but faith is never alone."

**Faith alone justifies** (no works added to earn salvation).

**But genuine faith is never alone** (it always produces works).

**Ephesians 2:8-10:** "For by grace you have been saved through faith... not a result of works... For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."

Saved by faith, not works (v. 8-9). But saved *for* good works (v. 10).

Works don't earn salvation. They're the fruit of salvation.

## What Must We Believe to Be Saved?

**Minimum content of saving faith:**

**1. God exists and is holy.**

**Hebrews 11:6:** "Whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists."

**2. I am a sinner in need of salvation.**

You can't trust Christ to save you if you don't think you need saving.

**3. Jesus is the Son of God who died and rose for sinners.**

**1 Corinthians 15:1-4:** "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day."

**4. Salvation is by grace through faith, not works.**

**Romans 10:9-10:** "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

**Can someone be saved with imperfect theology?**

Yes. The thief on the cross (Luke 23:42-43) had minimal knowledge—he just asked Jesus to remember him. Jesus promised, "Today you will be with me in paradise."

**Saving faith doesn't require perfect understanding.** It requires trust in Jesus.

**But: More knowledge leads to deeper faith.** The apostle Paul pursued knowledge of Christ his whole life (Philippians 3:10).

## Faith and Assurance

**Can you know you have genuine faith?**

### Calvinist View: Look to Christ, Not Self

**Assurance is based on:**
1. **God's promise:** "Whoever believes in him should not perish" (John 3:16).
2. **Christ's finished work:** "It is finished" (John 19:30).
3. **The Spirit's witness:** "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (Romans 8:16).

**Don't introspect obsessively.** Look to Christ. If you're trusting Him, you're saved.

**1 John 5:13:** "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."

Assurance is possible.

### The Role of Fruit

**But if there's no fruit (no change, no works), question whether the faith is genuine.**

**Matthew 7:16-20:** "You will recognize them by their fruits... Every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit."

**1 John 2:3-4:** "By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says 'I know him' but does not keep his commandments is a liar."

**Obedience is evidence of genuine faith.**

Not perfect obedience (we all stumble, James 3:2). But a trajectory of growth, a desire to please God, fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

**If there's no fruit, examine your faith.** It might be intellectual assent without genuine trust.

## Faith as a Gift

**Is faith something we produce, or does God give it?**

**Ephesians 2:8:** "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God."

**What is the gift?** Salvation, or faith itself?

**Calvinist view:** Faith is the gift. God grants faith to the elect. We can't generate it ourselves.

**Philippians 1:29:** "For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake."

Faith is "granted"—given by God.

**Acts 13:48:** "As many as were appointed to eternal life believed."

Appointment precedes belief. God enables faith.

**Arminian view:** Salvation (not faith) is the gift. God provides grace that enables us to believe, but we must choose to exercise faith.

**John 3:16:** "Whoever believes..." The invitation is universal. Anyone can believe if they choose.

**The tension:**

**Commands to believe** imply responsibility ("Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved," Acts 16:31).

**Statements that faith is given** imply God's sovereignty (Ephesians 2:8).

**Resolution?**

God enables faith (we can't believe apart from His grace). But we're responsible to believe (the command is real).

**Philippians 2:12-13:** "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work."

We work because God works. We believe because God enables.

## Growing in Faith

**Faith isn't static. It can grow or weaken.**

**Luke 17:5:** The apostles say, "Increase our faith!"

**Mark 9:24:** A father cries, "I believe; help my unbelief!"

**Faith exists on a spectrum:** Weak faith, strong faith, little faith, great faith.

**Matthew 8:26:** Jesus rebukes the disciples for "little faith."

**Matthew 15:28:** Jesus commends the Canaanite woman for "great faith."

**How does faith grow?**

**1. Hearing the Word.**

**Romans 10:17:** "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."

Scripture teaches us who God is, what He's done, what He's promised. Knowledge fuels trust.

**2. Prayer.**

**Mark 9:24:** "I believe; help my unbelief!" Honest prayer strengthens faith.

**3. Experience.**

As we see God's faithfulness in our lives, our trust deepens.

**Romans 5:3-4:** "Suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope."

**4. Fellowship.**

**Hebrews 10:24-25:** "Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together... but encouraging one another."

Community strengthens faith.

## Faith and Sight

**2 Corinthians 5:7:** "For we walk by faith, not by sight."

**Hebrews 11:1:** "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."

**Faith is trust without full evidence.** We don't see God, don't see heaven, don't see the final outcome. But we trust.

**John 20:29:** Jesus tells Thomas, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

**The Christian life is lived in tension:**
- We have some evidence (Scripture, creation, changed lives, the Spirit's witness).
- We lack absolute proof (we can't see God, can't empirically verify heaven).

**Faith bridges the gap.** It's confident trust based on God's character and promises, even without seeing the end.

**One day, faith will become sight.**

**1 Corinthians 13:12:** "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known."

At Christ's return, we'll see Him. Faith will give way to sight.

## The Object of Faith: Christ Alone

**What makes faith saving is not the strength of the faith, but the object of the faith.**

**Weak faith in the right object (Christ) saves.**

**Strong faith in the wrong object (self, good works, false gods) doesn't save.**

**Analogy:** A child's weak grip on a strong rope is safer than a strong grip on a rotten rope.

**It's not about how much you believe, but *whom* you believe in.**

**Acts 4:12:** "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."

**Christ is the object.** Faith in anything or anyone else is misplaced.

## Faith and Repentance

**Are faith and [repentance](#salvation/return 'Hebrew') the same?**

**No, but they're inseparable.**

**Repentance:** Turning *from* sin.

**Faith:** Turning *to* Christ.

**Mark 1:15:** "Repent and believe in the gospel."

Both are necessary. You can't trust Christ while clinging to sin. And you can't genuinely forsake sin without trusting Christ for forgiveness and transformation.

**Acts 20:21:** "Testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."

Two sides of the same coin. Repentance without faith is despair. Faith without repentance is presumption.

## Faithfulness: The Ongoing Dimension

**Hebrew *emunah* includes faithfulness—ongoing loyalty, not just initial trust.**

**Revelation 2:10:** "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."

**Hebrews 3:14:** "For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end."

**Faith isn't just "I believed once." It's "I continue believing."**

**This is [perseverance](#salvation/perseverance 'Greek'):** True believers endure. They don't have perfect faith, but their faith doesn't ultimately fail.

**Luke 22:32:** Jesus tells Peter, "I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail."

**The promise:** God preserves the faith of His people. They will persevere.

## Eilu V'Eilu: Trust and Faithfulness

**Greek emphasis:** Faith as mental act—believing the gospel, trusting Christ for [justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek').

**Hebrew emphasis:** Faith as relational loyalty—covenant faithfulness, ongoing trust lived out in obedience.

**Both are biblical.**

We need the Greek clarity: Salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone. Not works.

We need the Hebrew warmth: Faith is not just intellectual. It's relational trust and covenant loyalty.

**Faith is:**
- A gift from God (Ephesians 2:8).
- A response to the gospel (Romans 10:17).
- Trust in Christ alone (Acts 4:12).
- The instrument of [justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek') (Romans 5:1).
- Living and active, producing works (James 2:17).
- Ongoing and growing (Mark 9:24).
- Confident hope in what we can't yet see (Hebrews 11:1).

**The simplicity:** Trust Jesus. Rest your full weight on Him. He will not fail you.

**The profundity:** This trust transforms everything—how we think, live, love, suffer, hope, and die.

"The righteous shall live by faith" (Romans 1:17).
