# Glorification: The Final Perfection

Salvation has three stages in time:
- **Justification:** The moment we believe, God declares us righteous.
- **Sanctification:** From conversion to death, God makes us holy.
- **Glorification:** At Christ's return, God perfects us completely.

Glorification is the finish line. The work God started in [justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek') and continued in [sanctification](#salvation/sanctification 'Greek') is finally completed.

**Romans 8:30:** "Those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified."

Notice: Glorified is in the *past tense* (aorist). From God's eternal perspective, it's already accomplished. It's certain.

## What Is Glorification?

**Glorification is the complete removal of sin and the full restoration of humanity to God's intended glory.**

**1 John 3:2:** "Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is."

We will be *like Christ*—fully conformed to His image, without any remaining sin.

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."

This conformity begins in sanctification but completes in glorification.

### What Changes at Glorification?

**1. Sin is completely removed.**

In this life, we fight sin. In glorification, sin is gone—not just forgiven, but eradicated.

**Revelation 21:27:** "Nothing unclean will ever enter [the New Jerusalem]."

**Ephesians 5:27:** "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her... that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish."

No indwelling sin. No temptation. No struggle. We'll be perfectly, permanently holy.

**2. We receive resurrection bodies.**

**1 Corinthians 15:42-44:** "So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body."

**Philippians 3:20-21:** "Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body."

Our bodies will be like Christ's [resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill') body—physical but imperishable, powerful, glorious.

**3. We see God face to face.**

**Revelation 22:4:** "They will see his face."

In this life, we walk by faith, not sight (2 Corinthians 5:7). In glorification, we see God directly.

**1 Corinthians 13:12:** "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known."

The veil is removed. We behold God's glory without mediation.

**4. Creation is renewed.**

Glorification isn't just individual—it's cosmic. The whole creation is redeemed.

**Romans 8:21:** "The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God."

The earth was cursed because of sin (Genesis 3:17). When believers are glorified, creation is liberated.

**Revelation 21:1:** "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away."

**2 Peter 3:13:** "We are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."

Not the destruction of the physical universe, but its renewal. Heaven and earth united (Revelation 21:2-3).

## The Resurrection Body

Glorification is not escaping the body (Gnostic/Platonic). It's receiving a *glorified* body.

### Physical, but Transformed

**Luke 24:39-43:** After His resurrection, Jesus tells the disciples, "A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." He eats fish.

Christ's resurrection body was physical—touchable, recognizable, capable of eating.

But also transformed:
- He appeared in locked rooms (John 20:19).
- He ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9).
- He was sometimes unrecognized (Luke 24:16).

**Our resurrection bodies will be like His:** Physical, but no longer subject to decay, disease, or death.

### Continuity and Discontinuity

**1 Corinthians 15:35-38:** "But someone will ask, 'How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?' You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel... But God gives it a body as he has chosen."

The seed analogy: Your resurrection body is connected to your current body (continuity), but it's transformed beyond recognition (discontinuity).

**Continuity:** It's *you*—same person, same identity.

**Discontinuity:** It's radically upgraded—imperishable, glorious, powerful, spiritual (1 Corinthians 15:42-44).

### Imperishable

**1 Corinthians 15:53-54:** "For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: 'Death is swallowed up in victory.'"

No more aging. No more sickness. No more death.

**Revelation 21:4:** "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."

Glorified bodies are immune to decay. They last forever.

### Glorious

**Philippians 3:21:** Christ will "transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body."

What does "glorious" mean?

**Matthew 17:2 (Transfiguration):** "He was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light."

**Daniel 12:3:** "Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever."

Radiance. Splendor. Reflecting God's glory.

We'll bear the *image of God* (Genesis 1:26-27) perfectly, as originally intended before [the Fall](#man/fall 'Drill').

### Spiritual

**1 Corinthians 15:44:** "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body."

"Spiritual body" doesn't mean immaterial. It means animated and empowered by the Holy Spirit, not by the flesh.

**Currently:** Our bodies are weak, limited, dying.

**Glorified:** Our bodies will be strong, unlimited (in some sense), eternal.

## When Does Glorification Happen?

**At the return of Christ.**

**1 Thessalonians 4:16-17:** "For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord."

**The sequence:**
1. Christ returns.
2. The dead in Christ are resurrected (glorified bodies).
3. Living believers are transformed (glorified bodies).
4. All believers meet Christ.

**1 Corinthians 15:51-52:** "Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed."

**Instantaneous transformation.** Glorification is immediate, not gradual like sanctification.

## The Intermediate State: Between Death and Resurrection

**What happens to believers who die before Christ returns?**

**Their souls go to be with Christ immediately.**

**2 Corinthians 5:8:** "We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord."

**Philippians 1:23:** "My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."

**Luke 23:43:** Jesus tells the thief on the cross, "Today you will be with me in paradise."

**Conscious, blessed presence with Christ.** Not unconscious "soul sleep." Not purgatory (no purging needed—justification is complete).

**But:** This is not yet glorification. The soul is with Christ, but the body awaits resurrection.

**Full salvation = soul and body reunited in glorified state.**

**Revelation 6:9-11:** The martyrs are conscious in heaven, but they're told to "rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants... should be complete." They're waiting for the final resurrection.

## The New Heavens and New Earth

Glorification is not just about individual believers. It's about the entire cosmos.

**Isaiah 65:17:** "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind."

**Revelation 21:1-4:** "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away... And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.'"

### Not Destruction, but Renewal

**Some think:** The earth will be destroyed, and we'll live in a purely spiritual heaven forever.

**But the biblical picture:** The earth will be *renewed*, not annihilated.

**Romans 8:21:** "The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption."

Not "destroyed and replaced," but "liberated and restored."

**2 Peter 3:10-13:** "The heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved... But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."

**Interpretation debate:**

Does "burned up and dissolved" mean total destruction?

Or does it mean purification by fire (like refining metal), removing corruption but preserving the essence?

**The analogy to our bodies:** Not discarded and replaced, but transformed. Similarly, creation is transformed, not obliterated.

### Heaven on Earth

**Revelation 21:2-3:** "I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God... 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.'"

**Heaven comes to earth.** God and humanity dwell together in a renewed creation.

**Revelation 21:22-23:** "I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light."

God's presence fills everything. No separation between sacred and secular. All of creation is the temple.

**This is the original design (Genesis 1-2) fulfilled.** God walked with Adam and Eve in the garden (Genesis 3:8). In glorification, God dwells with His people forever.

## Glorification and God's Glory

**Why is it called "glorification"?**

Because we finally reflect God's glory perfectly.

**Romans 3:23:** "All have sinned and fall short of the *glory of God*."

Sin robbed us of glory—the image of God was marred.

**Romans 8:18:** "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the *glory that is to be revealed to us*."

Glorification restores the glory we lost.

**2 Corinthians 3:18:** "We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another."

Sanctification begins the transformation. Glorification completes it.

**We become what we were always meant to be:** Image-bearers who fully, perfectly reflect the glory of God.

## Already, Not Yet

**In one sense, we're already glorified (Romans 8:30—past tense).**

From God's eternal perspective, it's certain. What He predestined, He completes.

**In another sense, we're not yet glorified (1 John 3:2—"has not yet appeared").**

From our temporal perspective, we await it.

**The tension of Christian existence:**

**Already:** Justified, adopted, indwelt by the Spirit, seated with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6).

**Not yet:** Still sinning, suffering, dying, groaning for redemption (Romans 8:23).

**Romans 8:23:** "We ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies."

We have the Spirit (already). We await bodily redemption (not yet).

## The Certainty of Glorification

**Can believers lose their glorification?**

No. If you're justified, you *will* be glorified.

**Romans 8:30:** "Those whom he justified he also glorified."

The chain is unbreakable. Justification guarantees glorification.

**Philippians 1:6:** "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."

God finishes what He starts.

**1 Thessalonians 5:23-24:** "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it."

Our faithfulness wavers. God's doesn't. He guarantees the outcome.

This is the doctrine of [perseverance](#salvation/perseverance 'Greek')—believers will persevere because God preserves them unto glorification.

## Motivation for Now

**Why does glorification matter today?**

**1. It gives hope in suffering.**

**Romans 8:18:** "The sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us."

Present pain is temporary. Future glory is eternal. The ratio makes current suffering endurable.

**2 Corinthians 4:17:** "This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison."

**2. It shapes how we live now.**

**1 John 3:2-3:** "When he appears we shall be like him... And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure."

The hope of glorification motivates present holiness.

If we'll be sinless then, we pursue holiness now.

**Colossians 3:1-4:** "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above... When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."

Our future glory reorients current priorities. We live in light of what's coming.

**3. It reframes our view of the body and creation.**

Glorification is physical, not just spiritual. The body matters. Creation matters.

**We're not waiting to escape the body (Gnosticism).** We're waiting for the body's resurrection and the earth's renewal.

This dignifies the material world. What God will renew, we steward now.

## Hebrew Framework: The Return from Exile

In the Hebrew [narrative](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew'), glorification is the ultimate return from exile.

**The pattern:**
- Eden: Humanity with God in paradise.
- Fall: Exile from God's presence (Genesis 3:23-24).
- Exodus: A partial return (God dwells with Israel in the tabernacle).
- Exile (Babylon): Israel exiled from the land and God's temple.
- Return (Ezra/Nehemiah): A partial restoration.
- New Exodus (Jesus): [Redemption](#salvation/redemption 'Hebrew') from sin, the Spirit poured out.
- Glorification: The final return—God dwelling with humanity forever.

**Revelation 21:3:** "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man."

Exile ends. God and humanity reunited. The garden restored (Revelation 22:1-2—tree of life, river of life).

**Glorification is coming home.**

## Both/And: Forensic Completion and Relational Consummation

**Greek lens:** Glorification is the final stage of salvation's ordo (order). Justification → Sanctification → Glorification. The logical sequence completes.

**Hebrew lens:** Glorification is the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9), the covenant consummated, God dwelling with His people.

Both are true.

We're perfected (Greek precision). We're united with God forever (Hebrew intimacy).

**The hope:** "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away" (Revelation 21:4).

The struggle ends. The transformation completes. The story reaches its climax.

And we dwell with God forever.
