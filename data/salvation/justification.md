title: Justification
---
[Salvation](#salvation/salvation 'Parent')
---
*Declared* righteous by [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill') alone—the courtroom verdict at the center of Protestant theology.

Greek term: *Dikaiosis* (δικαίωσις)—a forensic, legal declaration. Not *made* righteous (that's [sanctification](#salvation/sanctification 'Greek')), but *counted* righteous.

The mechanism: [Imputation](#salvation/justification 'Drill'). Christ's righteousness is credited to our account. Our sin is credited to His. The great exchange (2 Corinthians 5:21).

The instrument: Faith, not works. "For by [grace](#salvation/grace 'Greek') you have been saved through faith... not a result of works" (Ephesians 2:8-9).

# Justification: The Courtroom Verdict

How does a sinner stand before a holy God and not be condemned?

**The Greek answer:** Justification—a forensic declaration that changes our legal status. We were guilty; now we're declared righteous. Not because we *are* righteous, but because Christ's righteousness is *imputed* (credited) to us.

This is the doctrine Martin Luther called "the article on which the church stands or falls."

## The Meaning of "Justify"

### Hebrew: *Tsadaq* (צדק)

In the Old Testament, *tsadaq* means "to be in the right" or "to vindicate."

**Exodus 23:7:** "I will not justify the wicked."

**Isaiah 5:23:** "Woe to those... who acquit the guilty for a bribe."

To justify someone is to declare them righteous, to vindicate them in court. It's a legal term.

**Crucially:** It doesn't mean "to make righteous" (morally transform). It means "to declare righteous" (legal verdict).

### Greek: *Dikaioo* (δικαιόω)

**Romans 3:24:** "They are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."

**Romans 5:1:** "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

Paul uses courtroom language. God is the judge. We're the defendants. The verdict: justified—declared not guilty.

## The Problem: We're Actually Guilty

**Romans 3:23:** "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

We're not just accused of sin; we're actually guilty. Every human has violated God's law ([the Fall](#man/fall 'Drill') broke us). We deserve condemnation.

**The dilemma:** How can a just God declare guilty people righteous? Wouldn't that make Him complicit in injustice?

**Proverbs 17:15:** "He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD."

If God justifies the wicked (us), isn't He doing what He condemns?

## The Solution: Imputation

**Imputation** means "to credit to one's account."

**The double imputation:**
1. Our sin is imputed to Christ—He bears the penalty.
2. Christ's righteousness is imputed to us—we receive His perfect obedience.

**2 Corinthians 5:21:** "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

Christ takes our guilt. We receive His righteousness. The great exchange.

### Old Testament Pattern: The Scapegoat

**Leviticus 16:21-22:** "Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel... The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself."

The sins of the people are transferred to the goat, which is sent into the wilderness.

**Type:** The scapegoat.
**Fulfillment:** Christ, who "bore our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24).

### Abraham's Faith

**Genesis 15:6:** "Abram believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness."

**Romans 4:3-5:** "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness... To the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness."

Abraham wasn't righteous by his own merit (he lied, doubted, tried to fulfill God's promise through Hagar). But God *counted* him righteous because he believed.

**Imputation:** God credited righteousness to Abraham's account based on faith.

## Faith Alone (Sola Fide)

**The Reformation's central battle:** Are we justified by faith alone, or by faith plus works?

**Rome (Council of Trent):** Faith *and* works. Justification is a process. We're made righteous gradually through the sacraments and good deeds.

**Protestants (Luther, Calvin):** Faith *alone*. Justification is a one-time declaration. God counts us righteous the moment we believe.

### Biblical Case for Faith Alone

**Romans 3:28:** "For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law."

**Galatians 2:16:** "A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ."

**Ephesians 2:8-9:** "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

**Titus 3:5:** "He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy."

**The logic:** If justification depends on our works, then:
1. Salvation is earned, not a gift.
2. We can boast ("I merited it").
3. We can never be sure (Have I done enough?).

**Faith alone** means:
1. Salvation is a gift.
2. Glory goes to God, not us.
3. We can be certain (it depends on Christ, not me).

### The Catholic Objection: James 2:24

**James 2:24:** "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone."

**The only time "faith alone" appears in Scripture—and it's negated!**

**Protestant response:**

James is addressing a different question. Paul asks: "How are we initially justified before God?" (Answer: Faith alone.) James asks: "What kind of faith justifies?" (Answer: Living faith that produces works.)

**James 2:17:** "Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."

James isn't contradicting Paul. He's clarifying that saving faith *always* produces obedience. If someone claims to have faith but shows no works, their "faith" is false—it's not the kind of faith that justifies.

**Analogy:** Fire produces heat. If there's no heat, there's no fire. Heat doesn't create fire; it proves fire exists. Similarly, works don't create justification; they prove justification occurred.

**Paul:** Justified by faith *apart from* works (Romans 3:28).
**James:** Justified by faith that *results in* works (James 2:24).

Both are true. Different emphases, not contradictions.

## Justification vs. Sanctification

**Critical distinction:**

**Justification:** What God declares about us (legal status).
**Sanctification:** What God does in us (moral transformation).

**Justification:**
- Instantaneous (happens at conversion)
- Complete (we're fully justified, not partially)
- External (Christ's righteousness credited to us)
- Unchanging (we don't become more or less justified)

**Sanctification:**
- Progressive (happens over a lifetime)
- Incomplete (we're still being made holy)
- Internal (the Spirit transforms us)
- Growing (we become more sanctified)

**Romans 6:7:** "For one who has died has been set free from sin." (Justification—already done.)

**Philippians 2:12:** "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." (Sanctification—ongoing process.)

**The danger of confusing them:**

If justification is progressive (Roman Catholic view), then:
- We're never fully justified in this life.
- We must do good works to complete justification.
- Assurance is impossible (How do I know I've done enough?).

If justification is instantaneous (Protestant view), then:
- We're fully justified the moment we believe.
- Good works are the result, not the cause.
- Assurance is possible (Christ's work is finished; it doesn't depend on mine).

## Imputed vs. Imparted Righteousness

**Protestant view:** Christ's righteousness is *imputed* (credited) to us. We're declared righteous because His righteousness is counted as ours.

**Catholic view:** Christ's righteousness is *imparted* (given) to us. We're made righteous through the Holy Spirit's sanctifying work.

**Protestant response:** Both happen, but justification is specifically about imputation.

- **Imputation (justification):** God counts Christ's righteousness as ours. Legal change.
- **Impartation (sanctification):** God makes us actually righteous. Moral change.

**Why the distinction matters:**

If justification is based on imparted righteousness (what God does *in* us), then salvation depends partly on our transformation. We're saved based on how holy we've become.

If justification is based on imputed righteousness (what God counts *to* us), then salvation depends entirely on Christ. We're saved based on His holiness, not ours.

**Romans 4:5:** "To the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness."

God justifies the *ungodly*—not people who've become godly, but people who are still sinners. He counts them righteous based on Christ, not based on their own transformation.

## Is Justification a "Legal Fiction"?

**Objection:** If we're still actually sinful, but God declares us righteous, isn't that a lie? Isn't God pretending we're something we're not?

**Response:**

Justification is legal, not fictional.

**Analogy:** Adoption.

When you adopt a child, you declare them your legal heir. They have all the rights of a biological child. Are you "pretending" they're your child? No. Legally, they *are* your child, even though biologically they're not.

Similarly, God declares us legally righteous in Christ, even though morally we're still being sanctified. It's not fiction; it's a legal verdict based on Christ's righteousness, not ours.

**Union with Christ** is the key. We're not isolated individuals whom God arbitrarily counts as righteous. We're united to Christ by faith. His righteousness becomes ours because we're "in Him" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

## The Hebrew Tension: Covenant, Not Just Courtroom

The forensic model is biblically grounded (Paul uses courtroom language repeatedly). But is it the whole picture?

**Hebrew perspective:** Justification isn't just legal standing; it's covenant relationship restored.

**Romans 5:1:** "Since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God."

Peace with God isn't just "not guilty." It's restored relationship. The broken [covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew') is renewed.

**Galatians 3:26-29:** "In Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith... And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise."

Justification brings us into the family. We're not just acquitted defendants; we're adopted children.

**The question:** Can we separate legal justification from relational adoption? Or are they two sides of the same salvation?

## Assurance: How Do I Know I'm Justified?

**If justification is by faith alone, how do I know my faith is real?**

**Protestant answer:** Look to Christ, not yourself.

**1 John 5:13:** "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."

Assurance is possible. It's based on:
1. **God's promise:** He says those who believe are justified (Romans 5:1).
2. **Christ's work:** Justification depends on what He did, not what I do.
3. **The Spirit's witness:** "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (Romans 8:16).

**Catholic answer:** We can have moral certainty, but not absolute certainty. Justification is a process. We must persevere in faith and works. Presumption (claiming certainty) is a sin.

**The tension:** If assurance is impossible, we live in fear. If assurance is presumptuous, we risk complacency.

**Resolution?** Assurance based on Christ's finished work, not our performance. But genuine faith produces fruit ([perseverance](#salvation/perseverance 'Greek')). If there's no fruit, question whether the faith is genuine.

## Justification and Judgment

**If we're justified, why does Scripture speak of future judgment based on works?**

**Romans 2:6:** "He will render to each one according to his works."

**Matthew 25:31-46:** Sheep and goats judged by their deeds (feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, etc.).

**Revelation 20:12:** "The dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done."

**Protestant answer:**

Judgment by works isn't about earning justification. It's about demonstrating that justification occurred.

- **Justification:** Declared righteous by faith at conversion.
- **Final judgment:** Vindication of the justified. Works prove that faith was genuine.

**James 2:18:** "Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."

Works don't justify. They verify. The final judgment reveals who truly believed.

**Those justified by faith will have works.** Not perfect works, but evidence of transformation. If there's no fruit, there was no root.

## Eilu V'Eilu: Legal and Relational

Perhaps justification is both forensic declaration *and* covenant restoration.

Perhaps we need the clarity of "declared righteous" to avoid works-righteousness.

And we need the relational warmth of "adopted into the family" to avoid cold legalism.

**Legal:** God counts us righteous in Christ.
**Relational:** God brings us into covenant relationship.

Both true. Both necessary. The Greek precision and the Hebrew intimacy.

Justified by faith alone—yet never a faith that remains alone.
