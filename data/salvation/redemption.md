[Salvation](#salvation/salvation 'Parent')
---
*Bought back* from slavery—the Exodus pattern applied to salvation in Christ.

Hebrew: *Ga'al* (גאל)—to redeem, to buy back. The *goel* is the kinsman-redeemer, the family member who rescues relatives from slavery or poverty.

Greek: *Apolytrōsis* (ἀπολύτρωσις)—release through ransom payment.

Salvation as liberation, not just legal declaration. God rescues His people from bondage (Egypt, sin, death) and brings them into freedom.

# Redemption: The Exodus Pattern

The Hebrew narrative of salvation begins with slavery and deliverance.

**Exodus 6:6:** "Say therefore to the people of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will *redeem you* with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.'"

**Redemption:** God buying back His people from bondage.

This is not abstract [justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek') (legal declaration). This is concrete rescue—physical, historical, dramatic.

And it becomes the pattern for understanding salvation in Christ.

## The Meaning of "Redeem"

### Hebrew: *Ga'al* (גאל)

**To redeem, to buy back, to act as kinsman-redeemer.**

The *goel* (גֹּאֵל) is the family member responsible for rescuing a relative in distress.

**Leviticus 25:47-49:** If an Israelite becomes enslaved to a foreigner, "a close relative may redeem him... or if he himself has the means, he may redeem himself."

**The goel's duties:**
1. **Buy back family land** sold in poverty (Leviticus 25:25).
2. **Redeem enslaved family members** (Leviticus 25:48).
3. **Avenge the blood** of a murdered relative (Numbers 35:19).
4. **Marry a widow** to preserve the family line (Ruth 3-4).

**The principle:** The goel restores what was lost, rescues what was enslaved, protects the vulnerable.

### The Book of Ruth: Boaz the Goel

**Ruth 4:1-10:** Boaz redeems Ruth (a poor, foreign widow) and Naomi's family land.

**Why?** Because he's a *goel*—a kinsman with the right and responsibility to redeem.

**Typology:** Boaz prefigures Christ, the ultimate Goel who redeems His people.

- Ruth is destitute; we're spiritually bankrupt.
- Boaz pays the price; Christ pays with His [blood](#salvation/blood 'Hebrew').
- Boaz marries Ruth; Christ takes the church as His bride.

### Greek: *Apolytrōsis* (ἀπολύτρωσις)

**Release obtained through paying a ransom.**

**Ephesians 1:7:** "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses."

**Colossians 1:13-14:** "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."

**The imagery:** We were enslaved (to sin, Satan, death). Christ paid the price (His blood) to free us.

## The Exodus as the Paradigm

The Exodus is the foundational redemption event in Hebrew Scripture. All later salvation language draws from it.

### The Slavery

**Exodus 1:13-14:** "So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves and made their lives bitter with hard service."

Israel was enslaved in Egypt—brick-making, forced labor, oppression. They cried out to God (Exodus 2:23).

**The spiritual parallel:** Humanity is enslaved to sin and death.

**John 8:34:** "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin."

**Romans 6:17:** "You were once slaves of sin."

We're in bondage—unable to free ourselves, crying out for rescue.

### The Deliverance

**Exodus 12-14:** God sends plagues, kills the firstborn (except where blood is applied to doorposts), and parts the Red Sea. Israel walks free. Egypt's army drowns.

**God acts:** Not Israel earning freedom, but God rescuing them by power.

**Exodus 14:13-14:** "Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD... The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent."

Israel doesn't fight. God fights. They watch as He delivers.

**The spiritual parallel:** Salvation is God's act, not ours.

**Ephesians 2:8-9:** "For by [grace](#salvation/grace 'Hebrew') you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works."

We don't redeem ourselves. God redeems us.

### The Cost

**Exodus 12:21-23:** The Passover lamb is slain. Its blood marks the doorposts. Death passes over.

**The lamb dies so the firstborn lives.** Substitution.

**1 Corinthians 5:7:** "Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."

**John 1:29:** "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world."

Christ is the Lamb. His blood protects from judgment. His death purchases our freedom.

**1 Peter 1:18-19:** "You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot."

The cost of redemption: Christ's life.

### The New Identity

After the Exodus, Israel is no longer "slaves in Egypt." They're "the people of the LORD," freed to serve Him.

**Exodus 19:4-6:** "You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples... and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."

**Redemption brings relationship.** God didn't just free them *from* slavery; He brought them *to* Himself.

**The spiritual parallel:**

**Titus 2:14:** "He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession."

We're redeemed *to belong to God*—His treasured possession, His covenant people.

## Redemption in the New Testament

### Jesus as Goel

Jesus is the kinsman-redeemer.

**He becomes human (kinsman):**

**Hebrews 2:14-15:** "Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery."

To be our *goel*, Jesus had to be family—human like us.

**He pays the price (redeemer):**

**Mark 10:45:** "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

**1 Timothy 2:5-6:** "For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all."

The ransom: His life.

**He brings us to Himself (relationship):**

**Ephesians 2:13:** "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ."

Redemption isn't just freedom from sin. It's adoption into God's family.

### From What Are We Redeemed?

**1. From slavery to sin.**

**Romans 6:18:** "Having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness."

Before Christ, we were slaves to sin—compelled to obey its desires. Now we're free to obey God.

**2. From the curse of the law.**

**Galatians 3:13:** "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us."

The law condemns us (we all break it). Christ bore the curse so we're free from condemnation.

**3. From bondage to Satan.**

**Colossians 1:13:** "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son."

We were captive to the evil one. Christ liberated us.

**4. From death.**

**Hebrews 2:14-15:** Christ "might destroy the one who has the power of death... and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery."

Death held us. Christ defeated it. We're freed from its power.

**5. From wrath.**

**1 Thessalonians 1:10:** "Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come."

We deserved judgment. Christ redeems us from it.

### For What Are We Redeemed?

Redemption has a purpose. We're freed *from* slavery *for* something.

**1. To belong to God.**

**Titus 2:14:** "He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession."

We're His. Treasured possession.

**2. To serve God.**

**Romans 6:22:** "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life."

Freedom from sin doesn't mean autonomy. It means serving God instead of sin.

**3. To live righteously.**

**1 Peter 1:14-16:** "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct."

Redemption calls us to holiness.

**4. To proclaim God's excellencies.**

**1 Peter 2:9:** "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."

We're redeemed to be witnesses.

## To Whom Is the Ransom Paid?

**The question:** If redemption is paying a price, to whom was the price paid?

### Three Views

**1. Paid to Satan (Ransom to the Devil Theory)**

**Early church view (Origen, Gregory of Nyssa):** Christ's death was a ransom paid to Satan, who held humanity captive.

**Problem:** Why would God owe Satan anything? This gives Satan unwarranted power and legitimacy.

**Gregory's twist:** The cross is a trap. Satan takes Jesus (thinking he's just another human), but can't hold Him (He's God). Satan loses Jesus and forfeits his claim on humanity.

**Modern view:** Mostly abandoned. Too much power to Satan.

**2. Paid to God's Justice (Satisfaction/Penal Substitution)**

**Anselm, Reformed theology:** The price is paid to satisfy God's justice.

Sin offends God. Justice demands payment. Christ pays the debt by dying in our place.

**This shifts the metaphor:** Not literally a ransom paid to someone holding us, but a debt paid to satisfy divine justice.

**3. The Price Is Real, but No Transaction with a Party**

**Redemption language is metaphorical, not commercial.** The "price" is the costliness of salvation (Christ's death), not a literal transaction.

**The point:** Redemption cost God everything. Christ's blood is infinitely valuable. It's not paid *to* anyone; it's the means by which God accomplishes deliverance.

**1 Peter 1:18-19** emphasizes the preciousness of the blood, not the recipient of payment.

## Redemption and Liberation Theology

**Liberation theology (Latin America, 20th century):** Exodus as paradigm for political liberation.

**The claim:** God sides with the oppressed. Redemption isn't just spiritual; it's social, economic, political. The gospel liberates from poverty, injustice, tyranny.

**Strengths:**
- Takes the Exodus seriously as historical, material deliverance.
- Emphasizes God's care for the poor and oppressed (Exodus 3:7—"I have seen the misery of my people").
- Challenges the church to pursue justice, not just individual salvation.

**Critiques:**
- Can reduce salvation to political liberation, minimizing the spiritual (sin, forgiveness, eternal life).
- Can endorse Marxist revolution uncritically, ignoring human sinfulness on all sides.
- Risks making God's kingdom merely earthly, neglecting [glorification](#salvation/glorification 'Greek') and eternal hope.

**The tension:**

Is salvation primarily spiritual (freedom from sin's guilt) or material (freedom from oppression)?

**The biblical answer:** Both.

**Luke 4:18-19 (Jesus quoting Isaiah):** "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."

Jesus brings both spiritual and material redemption. The two can't be separated.

## Redemption as Restoration

Hebrew redemption isn't just rescue from danger. It's *restoration* to what was lost.

**Job 19:25:** "For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth."

The Redeemer (*goel*) restores what was taken by death.

**Isaiah 43:1:** "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine."

Redemption restores relationship—belonging to God.

**Isaiah 51:11:** "And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads."

Redemption brings [return](#salvation/return 'Hebrew') from exile. Coming home.

**The pattern:**

- **Creation:** Humanity in fellowship with God.
- **Fall:** Relationship broken, humanity exiled.
- **Redemption:** Bought back, brought home.
- **Glorification:** Fully restored, dwelling with God forever (Revelation 21:3).

Redemption is the journey from exile to home.

## The Already and Not Yet of Redemption

**Ephesians 1:7:** "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses."

**Present tense.** We *have* redemption. It's accomplished.

**But also:**

**Romans 8:23:** "We ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies."

**Future tense.** We *await* redemption of our bodies.

**The tension:**

**Already redeemed:** Forgiven, set free from sin's penalty, adopted into God's family.

**Not yet redeemed:** Still in mortal bodies, still groaning, still waiting for full deliverance.

**Full redemption comes at Christ's return:**

**Luke 21:28:** "Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."

**Hebrews 9:28:** "Christ... will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him."

The Exodus was a one-time event, but the journey to the Promised Land took 40 years.

Similarly, redemption was accomplished at the cross, but the full experience awaits [glorification](#salvation/glorification 'Greek').

## Redemption and Worship

**Why did God redeem Israel from Egypt?**

**Exodus 7:16:** "Let my people go, that they may serve me."

Redemption's purpose: worship.

They were enslaved to Pharaoh. God freed them to serve Him instead.

**Romans 12:1:** "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship."

Redemption calls us to worship—offering our lives to God.

**1 Corinthians 6:19-20:** "You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body."

We're bought. We belong to God. Our response: worship through how we live.

## The Cost of Redemption: The Cross

Redemption is costly. It cost God His Son.

**1 Peter 1:18-19:** "You were ransomed... not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ."

**Revelation 5:9:** "Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation."

The price: Christ's blood.

The scope: All nations.

The result: A people for God.

## Redemption and Covenant

Redemption and [covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew') are inseparable.

God didn't just free Israel and leave them. He made covenant with them at Sinai.

**Exodus 19:4-5:** "You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession."

**Redemption establishes covenant.** Rescue leads to relationship.

Similarly, Christ's redemption brings us into the New Covenant.

**Luke 22:20:** "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood."

His blood redeems and seals the covenant.

## Hebrew vs. Greek: Rescue vs. Declaration

**Greek framework (justification):** Legal declaration. God counts us righteous. Forensic, courtroom language.

**Hebrew framework (redemption):** Rescue operation. God delivers us from bondage. Concrete, narrative language.

**Both are biblical. Both are necessary.**

**Justification** explains *how* we're made right with God (legal basis).

**Redemption** explains *what* God does for us (rescue from slavery).

**The cross accomplishes both:**
- Satisfies justice ([justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek')).
- Pays the ransom (redemption).

**The result:**
- We're declared righteous.
- We're brought out of bondage.

**Perhaps redemption is more relational, more earthy, more narrative.** It's the Exodus retold. It's Boaz marrying Ruth. It's the father running to embrace the prodigal.

And perhaps that's why it resonates so deeply. We're not just acquitted in court. We're bought back, brought home, and welcomed into the family.

"I am the LORD, and I will redeem you" (Exodus 6:6).
