title: Grace

[Salvation](#salvation/salvation 'Parent')
---
*Unmerited favor*—the heart of the gospel. But is it only forgiveness, or also empowerment?

Greek: *Charis* (χάρις)—favor, kindness, gift. In theology: God's unearned goodness toward sinners.

Hebrew: *Chesed* (חסד)—covenant love, loyal kindness, steadfast mercy. God's faithful love within relationship.

The tension: Is grace primarily *forensic* (undeserved pardon) or *dynamic* (transforming power)? A one-time gift or ongoing sustenance?

# Grace: The Undeserved Gift

"For by grace you have been saved through [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill'). And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).

Grace is the foundation of salvation. We don't earn it. We don't deserve it. God freely gives it.

But what exactly *is* grace? Forgiveness only, or also power? A legal pardon, or a transforming presence?

## The Meaning of "Grace"

### Greek: *Charis* (χάρις)

**Favor, kindness, gift, beauty.**

In classical Greek, *charis* meant:
- The beauty or attractiveness of something.
- A favor freely given (not earned or repaid).
- Gratitude for a gift received.

**In the NT:** God's unmerited favor toward sinners. The kindness that saves us despite our unworthiness.

**Romans 3:24:** "They are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."

**Titus 2:11:** "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people."

**Grace is the *source* of salvation.** Not our works, not our goodness. God's free gift.

### Hebrew: *Chesed* (חסד)

**Covenant love, steadfast love, loyal kindness, mercy.**

Often translated "lovingkindness" or "steadfast love."

**Exodus 34:6:** "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love (*chesed*) and faithfulness."

*Chesed* is:
- **Covenant loyalty:** God keeps His promises even when His people fail.
- **Relational kindness:** Not just legal favor, but personal affection and care.
- **Enduring mercy:** God's love doesn't waver.

**Psalm 136 (refrain repeated 26 times):** "For his steadfast love (*chesed*) endures forever."

*Chesed* is God's faithful covenant love—reliable, enduring, unshakable.

### Hebrew: *Chen* (חן)

**Favor, grace.**

**Genesis 6:8:** "But Noah found favor (*chen*) in the eyes of the LORD."

**Exodus 33:12-13:** Moses asks God, "Show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor (*chen*) in your sight."

*Chen* is finding favor with God—not because you earned it, but because God freely bestows it.

## Grace in the Old Testament: Covenant Loyalty

### God's Choosing Is Grace

**Deuteronomy 7:7-8:** "It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers."

God chose Israel—not because they deserved it, but because He loved them. Pure grace.

**Same with individuals:**

**Abraham:** Called by grace (Genesis 12:1-3). Not because he was righteous (he lied, doubted, tried to fulfill God's promise through Hagar).

**Jacob:** Chosen over Esau before they were born (Romans 9:11-13). Grace, not merit.

**David:** A shepherd boy, youngest of eight brothers, overlooked by everyone—but chosen by God (1 Samuel 16:7).

### God's Forgiveness Is Grace

**Exodus 34:6-7:** "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin."

God forgives—not because we deserve it, but because He is gracious.

**Psalm 103:10-12:** "He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love (*chesed*) toward those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us."

We deserve judgment. We receive mercy. That's grace.

### God's Patience Is Grace

**Numbers 14:** Israel rebels. God threatens to destroy them. Moses intercedes. God relents.

**Why?** Grace. "The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression" (Numbers 14:18).

**Nehemiah 9:17:** "But you are a God ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them."

Israel's whole history is a story of rebellion met with grace. They sin, God judges, they cry out, God forgives. Repeat.

**Why doesn't God just destroy them?** Grace.

## Grace in the New Testament: The Gift of Salvation

### The Incarnation Is Grace

**John 1:14:** "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."

**John 1:16-17:** "For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."

**The ultimate act of grace:** God becomes human, enters creation, lives among us, dies for us.

**2 Corinthians 8:9:** "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich."

Christ's descent is grace. He had everything, gave it up, became nothing—so we could have everything.

### The Cross Is Grace

**Romans 5:8:** "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

We didn't deserve rescue. We were enemies (Romans 5:10). Yet Christ died for us. Grace.

**Ephesians 1:7:** "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace."

Forgiveness flows from grace. Not earned, freely given.

**Titus 3:4-5:** "But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy."

Salvation is mercy, not merit. Grace, not wages.

### Justification Is by Grace

**Romans 3:23-24:** "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift."

[Justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek') is a gift. We don't earn it. We can't pay for it. Grace provides it.

**Romans 11:6:** "But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace."

**Grace and works are opposites.** If you earn it, it's wages. If you receive it freely, it's grace.

**Ephesians 2:8-9:** "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

**The logic:**
- If salvation were by works, we could boast ("I earned it").
- If salvation is by grace, we can only give thanks ("God gave it").

**Grace eliminates boasting.** All glory goes to God.

## The Tension: Favor vs. Power

### Grace as Unmerited Favor (Forensic)

**Traditional Protestant emphasis:** Grace is God's favor—pardon we don't deserve.

**The courtroom picture:**
- We're guilty.
- We deserve condemnation.
- God grants acquittal (justification) as a free gift.

**This is forensic grace:** Legal standing changed by God's unearned kindness.

**Strengths:**
- Protects the gospel from works-righteousness.
- Emphasizes God's initiative (we contribute nothing).
- Grounds assurance (it doesn't depend on us).

**Weakness:**
- Can sound distant, transactional, cold.

### Grace as Enabling Power (Dynamic)

**Eastern Orthodox and Catholic emphasis (also some Protestants):** Grace is God's empowering presence—strength to live righteously.

**2 Corinthians 12:9:** "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'"

Grace isn't just pardon. It's *power*. God's strength working in us.

**1 Corinthians 15:10:** "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me."

Paul worked hard—but it was grace empowering him. Not human effort alone, but grace-enabled effort.

**Titus 2:11-12:** "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives."

Grace doesn't just forgive. It *trains* us. It transforms.

**Strengths:**
- Emphasizes transformation, not just pardon.
- Grace is relational, not just legal.
- Highlights ongoing dependence on God.

**Weakness:**
- Can blur into works-righteousness if we think grace is something we cooperate with to earn salvation.

## Both/And: Favor and Power

**Perhaps grace is both:**

**1. Unmerited favor:** God forgives us freely. Justification.

**2. Enabling power:** God transforms us by His Spirit. [Sanctification](#salvation/sanctification 'Greek').

**Titus 2:11-14 combines both:**

"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people [favor], training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives [power]... who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession [favor and power together]."

**Grace saves us (favor). Grace changes us (power).**

**We don't earn grace. But grace produces fruit.**

## Irresistible Grace vs. Resistible Grace

**Can humans resist God's grace?**

### Calvinist View: Irresistible Grace (Effectual Calling)

**When God extends saving grace to the elect, they will certainly respond in [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill').**

**Grace is irresistible** (also called "effectual grace"). Not that you can't physically resist, but that God overcomes resistance and changes the heart so you freely choose to believe.

**John 6:37:** "All that the Father gives me will come to me."

**John 6:44:** "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."

God draws, and those He draws *will* come. Grace is effectual.

**Ezekiel 36:26-27:** "And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes."

God causes. He doesn't just enable—He effectually transforms.

**Philippians 2:13:** "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

God produces the will. He doesn't just offer grace and wait for us to choose. He works in us so we *do* choose.

**Why is grace irresistible?**

Because humans are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1). Dead people can't choose. God must make us alive first. And when He does, we respond.

### Arminian View: Resistible Grace (Prevenient Grace)

**God extends grace to all, enabling them to believe. But humans can resist.**

**Grace is resistible.** God enables, but doesn't force. We must cooperate.

**Acts 7:51:** "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit."

If grace were irresistible, how could they resist the Spirit?

**Matthew 23:37:** "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem... How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!"

Jesus wanted to gather them. They refused. Grace was offered, but resisted.

**The Arminian emphasis:** Human free will remains even after the Fall. God's grace restores the ability to choose, but doesn't override the will.

**Prevenient grace:** Grace that goes before (pre-venient). God gives everyone enough grace to respond to the gospel. If they believe, they're saved. If they reject, they're lost.

**John 1:9:** "The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world."

Everyone receives some light (prevenient grace). They can respond or reject.

### The Tension

**Calvinist danger:** If grace is irresistible, are humans just robots? Where is genuine choice?

**Calvinist response:** God changes the heart so we *freely* choose. It's not coercion; it's transformation. The will is freed, not forced.

**Arminian danger:** If grace is resistible, does salvation depend on human choice? Is God's grace not powerful enough to save?

**Arminian response:** God's grace is powerful, but He respects human freedom. He enables, but doesn't override the will.

**Eilu v'eilu?**

Perhaps both protect essential truths:
- **Calvinists protect:** God's sovereignty. Salvation is entirely His work.
- **Arminians protect:** Human responsibility. We genuinely choose.

**Can both be true?** The Bible commands us to choose (Joshua 24:15) and declares God chooses us (Ephesians 1:4). The mystery remains.

## Common Grace vs. Saving Grace

**Common grace:** God's kindness to all people, believers and unbelievers.

**Matthew 5:45:** "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."

God blesses everyone—food, beauty, relationships, talents. This is common grace.

**Saving grace:** God's grace that brings salvation—only to those who believe.

**Titus 2:11:** "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people."

Salvation is offered universally (common grace), but received only by faith (saving grace).

**Why the distinction matters:**

Unbelievers experience God's kindness (common grace), but not His saving work (saving grace). They enjoy blessings, but remain condemned apart from Christ.

## Means of Grace

**How does God deliver grace to us?**

**Traditional Protestant view:** Through the "means of grace"—channels God uses to convey His grace.

### 1. The Word (Scripture)

**1 Peter 1:23:** "You have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God."

God's Word regenerates, sanctifies, sustains.

**Romans 10:17:** "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."

The gospel message is the means God uses to create faith.

### 2. Sacraments/Ordinances (Baptism, Lord's Supper)

**Catholic/Orthodox view:** Sacraments *confer* grace. Grace flows through the physical elements when rightly administered.

**Protestant view (most):** Sacraments *signify and seal* grace. They don't create grace, but they confirm and strengthen faith.

**Romans 4:11:** Circumcision was "a sign and seal of the righteousness that [Abraham] had by faith."

Similarly, baptism and the Lord's Supper are signs and seals of God's covenant promises.

### 3. Prayer

**Hebrews 4:16:** "Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."

Prayer is approaching God's throne where grace is dispensed.

### 4. Fellowship (The Church)

**Hebrews 10:24-25:** "Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together... but encouraging one another."

Grace flows through community—mutual encouragement, teaching, accountability.

## Cheap Grace vs. Costly Grace

**Dietrich Bonhoeffer's famous distinction:**

### Cheap Grace

**Grace without cost, without discipleship, without the cross.**

"Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate."

**The danger:** Presuming on grace. "I'm saved by grace, so I can live however I want." No [repentance](#salvation/return 'Hebrew'), no transformation, no cost.

**Matthew 7:21-23:** "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father... Then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me.'"

Claiming grace without obedience is false.

### Costly Grace

**Grace that cost God everything (Christ's death) and costs us everything (taking up the cross).**

"Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock. Such grace is costly because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life."

**Luke 9:23:** "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me."

Grace is free (we don't earn it). But it's costly (it demands everything).

**Bonhoeffer's point:**

Grace is free, but it's not cheap. It cost Christ His life. And it calls us to die to self and live for Him.

## Grace and Law

**Does grace oppose the law, or fulfill it?**

**Romans 6:14-15:** "For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!"

**Grace doesn't abolish moral standards.** It frees us *from* the law's condemnation, but not *from* obedience to God.

**Titus 2:11-12:** "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions."

Grace trains us in godliness. It's not permission to sin; it's power to obey.

**The relationship:**
- **Law shows us our need** (reveals sin, drives us to Christ).
- **Grace saves us** (forgives, justifies).
- **Grace empowers us** (sanctifies, enables obedience).

**Romans 8:3-4:** "For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son... he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."

The law's goal is fulfilled in us—not by our effort, but by grace (the Spirit).

## Grace Upon Grace

**John 1:16:** "For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace."

**Literally:** "Grace instead of grace" or "grace after grace."

**The meaning:** Wave after wave of grace. Continuous, inexhaustible supply.

**Lamentations 3:22-23:** "The steadfast love (*chesed*) of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning."

**Every day:** Fresh grace. Yesterday's grace got you through yesterday. Today you need new grace. And it's there.

**2 Corinthians 12:9:** "My grace is sufficient for you."

Always enough. Never runs out.

## The Ultimate Grace: God Himself

**The greatest gift of grace isn't forgiveness, or heaven, or blessings.**

**It's God Himself.**

**Psalm 73:25-26:** "Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."

**Grace is knowing God.** Not just receiving gifts from Him, but having Him.

**Philippians 3:8:** "Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."

The ultimate grace: relationship with the Triune God, forever.

## Hebrew Warmth: Chesed as Covenant Loyalty

**Greek *charis* emphasizes the gift—unearned, freely given.**

**Hebrew *chesed* emphasizes the relationship—loyal love within covenant.**

**Both are essential.**

We need *charis* to remember: Salvation is a gift, not wages. We don't earn it. God gives it.

We need *chesed* to remember: Grace is not cold transaction. It's warm relationship. God's loyal love pursuing us, keeping covenant, never letting go.

**Grace is both:**
- **Gift** (charis): Freely given, undeserved.
- **Loyal love** (chesed): Covenant faithfulness, relational commitment.

"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8).

The gift of all gifts: God's saving grace.
