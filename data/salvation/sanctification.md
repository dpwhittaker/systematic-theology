title: Sanctification
---
[Salvation](#salvation/salvation 'Parent')
---
Progressive transformation into Christ's likeness—being *made* holy after being *declared* righteous.

Greek: *Hagiasmos* (ἁγιασμός)—the process of becoming holy, set apart for God.

The distinction: [Justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek') changes our legal status (declared righteous). Sanctification changes our character (made righteous).

The tension: Is it God's work alone (monergism) or God and us working together (synergism)? "Work out your own salvation... for it is God who works in you" (Philippians 2:12-13).

# Sanctification: Being Made Holy

Justification is instantaneous. Sanctification is lifelong.

Justification is what God declares *about* us. Sanctification is what God does *in* us.

**The goal:** "Be holy, for I am holy" (Leviticus 11:44, 1 Peter 1:16). Conformity to Christ's image.

**The question:** How does a sinner become holy?

## The Meaning of "Sanctify"

### Hebrew: *Qadash* (קדש)

**To set apart, to make holy, to consecrate.**

**Exodus 13:2:** "Consecrate to me all the firstborn."

**Leviticus 20:7-8:** "Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, for I am the LORD your God. Keep my statutes and do them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you."

*Qadash* has two dimensions:
1. **Positional:** Set apart from the common for God's purposes.
2. **Moral:** Made pure, clean, distinct from sin.

**Example:** The priests were sanctified (set apart for temple service) and had to maintain purity (avoiding defilement).

### Greek: *Hagiazō* (ἁγιάζω)

**To make holy, to sanctify, to set apart.**

**1 Thessalonians 5:23:** "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."

**Hebrews 10:10:** "We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."

**Sanctification in the NT:**
- **Already (positional):** We *are* sanctified—set apart in Christ (1 Corinthians 6:11).
- **Not yet (progressive):** We *are being* sanctified—transformed by the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:18).
- **Future (complete):** We *will be* sanctified—perfected at glorification (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

## Three Stages of Sanctification

### 1. Definitive Sanctification (Positional)

**At conversion, believers are set apart as holy.**

**1 Corinthians 6:11:** "You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."

Notice: Sanctified is in the *past tense*. It's already done.

**Hebrews 10:10:** "We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."

Christ's sacrifice set us apart. Positionally, we're already holy—not by our performance, but by His sacrifice.

**This is not moral perfection.** It's covenant status. God has claimed us as His own.

**Analogy:** When you get married, you're set apart exclusively for your spouse. That's your status the moment you say "I do," even though living out marital faithfulness is a lifelong journey.

### 2. Progressive Sanctification (Experiential)

**After conversion, the Spirit transforms us to become actually holy.**

**2 Corinthians 3:18:** "We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."

Notice: *Being* transformed (present continuous). It's ongoing.

**Philippians 1:6:** "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."

**The pattern:** God begins the work (regeneration), continues the work (progressive sanctification), and will complete the work ([glorification](#salvation/glorification 'Greek')).

**This is moral transformation.** The Spirit changes our desires, habits, character. We become more like Christ—more loving, patient, kind, self-controlled (Galatians 5:22-23).

### 3. Complete Sanctification (Eschatological)

**At Christ's return, sanctification will be finished. We'll be fully holy.**

**1 John 3:2:** "We know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is."

**Philippians 3:20-21:** "Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body."

**Revelation 21:27:** "Nothing unclean will ever enter [the New Jerusalem]."

**Complete sanctification** means:
- No more sin.
- No more temptation.
- No more struggle.
- Perfect holiness, forever.

This is glorification—the final stage of salvation.

## How Does Sanctification Happen?

**The key tension:** Is sanctification God's work or ours?

**Philippians 2:12-13:** "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

**Both.** God works. We work. But God's work empowers our work.

### God's Role: The Spirit's Work

**1 Thessalonians 5:23-24:** "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely... He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it."

God sanctifies. It's His work.

**How?**

**1. The Holy Spirit indwells believers (Romans 8:9).**

The Spirit is the agent of transformation. He lives in us, convicting us of sin, producing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23), and conforming us to Christ.

**2. The Spirit renews the mind (Romans 12:2).**

"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."

Sanctification begins with changed thinking. The Spirit teaches us truth, exposes lies, reorients our desires.

**3. The Spirit produces fruit (Galatians 5:22-23).**

"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."

These aren't achieved by willpower. They're *produced* by the Spirit.

**Vine and branches (John 15:4-5):** "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me."

We don't manufacture holiness. We abide in Christ, and the Spirit produces fruit.

### Our Role: Obedience and Effort

**Hebrews 12:14:** "Strive for... the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."

We're commanded to pursue holiness. It's not passive.

**How?**

**1. Put off sin, put on righteousness (Ephesians 4:22-24).**

"Put off your old self... and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."

Active verbs. We're responsible to fight sin and pursue godliness.

**Colossians 3:5:** "Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness."

This is spiritual warfare. We kill sin (Romans 8:13: "If by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live").

**2. Use the means of grace.**

- **Scripture:** "Your word is a lamp to my feet" (Psalm 119:105). The Bible teaches, convicts, corrects, trains (2 Timothy 3:16).
- **Prayer:** "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation" (Matthew 26:41). Prayer sustains dependence on God.
- **Sacraments/Ordinances:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper as reminders of [covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew') identity.
- **Community:** "Exhort one another every day... that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin" (Hebrews 3:13).
- **Suffering:** "We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character" (Romans 5:3-4).

**3. Walk by the Spirit (Galatians 5:16).**

"Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

Sanctification is cooperation: the Spirit empowers, we obey.

### Monergism vs. Synergism

**Monergism:** God alone works. (Mono = one, ergon = work.)

**Synergism:** God and humans work together. (Syn = together, ergon = work.)

**In justification:** Monergism. God alone justifies. We contribute nothing.

**In sanctification:** Both monergism and synergism, depending on how you define it.

**Reformed view (Calvinist):**

God works in us to produce transformation. We work because God works in us. But ultimately, God is the sole effective cause.

**Philippians 2:13:** "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

God doesn't just enable us; He causes us to will and to work.

**This is still monergism**—God's work produces our work. We're not adding to His work; we're the means through which His work is accomplished.

**Arminian view:**

God provides [grace](#salvation/grace 'Greek'), but we must cooperate. Sanctification requires our active participation alongside the Spirit's help.

**Philippians 2:12:** "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."

We're responsible. If we don't work, we won't grow in holiness.

**This is synergism**—God enables, but we must choose to cooperate.

**Resolution?**

Both emphases are biblical. God commands us to work (synergism language). God produces the work in us (monergism language).

**Perhaps:** We work *because* God works. The Spirit's work doesn't eliminate our effort; it enables and ensures it.

## Can We Achieve Sinless Perfection in This Life?

**Wesleyan/Holiness view:** Yes. Entire sanctification is possible. Believers can reach a state where they no longer willfully sin.

**John Wesley:** Not absolute perfection (mistakes remain), but "Christian perfection"—a heart fully devoted to God, free from intentional sin.

**1 John 3:6:** "No one who abides in him keeps on sinning."

**Reformed view:** No. We'll struggle with sin until we die.

**1 John 1:8:** "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."

**Romans 7:18-19:** "I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing."

Even Paul (mature believer, apostle) struggles with indwelling sin.

**Philippians 3:12:** "Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on."

Paul admits he's not yet perfect.

**The tension:**

- We're commanded not to sin (1 John 2:1).
- We're told we *will* sin (1 John 1:8).

**Resolution?**

Sinless perfection is the *goal*, not the current *reality*. We fight sin, grow in holiness, but won't be fully sanctified until [glorification](#salvation/glorification 'Greek').

**1 John 2:1:** "I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."

Don't sin. But when you do, there's forgiveness.

## The Law's Role in Sanctification

**Does the law (Torah, God's commandments) help us become holy, or does it just condemn us?**

**Three uses of the law (traditional Reformed view):**

### 1. Civil Use (Restraining Sin)

The law restrains evil in society. Even unbelievers know murder, theft, lying are wrong. The law maintains order.

### 2. Pedagogical Use (Revealing Sin)

The law shows us our sin, driving us to Christ.

**Romans 3:20:** "Through the law comes knowledge of sin."

**Galatians 3:24:** "The law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith."

The law is a mirror: it shows us we're dirty, but it can't clean us. Only Christ can.

### 3. Normative Use (Guiding the Believer)

**Does the law still guide Christians?**

**Yes (Reformed, most Protestants):** The moral law (Ten Commandments) still applies. It teaches us how to live in a way that pleases God.

**Psalm 119:97:** "Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day."

The psalmist delights in God's law.

**No (some Lutherans, dispensationalists):** Christians are free from the law. We're led by the Spirit, not commanded by rules.

**Romans 7:6:** "Now we are released from the law."

**Galatians 5:18:** "If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."

**Resolution?**

We're free from the law's *condemnation* (Romans 8:1). But the law's moral standards still reflect God's character. We're not saved by obeying the law, but the law still shows us what holiness looks like.

**Jesus summarizes the law:** "Love God with all your heart... and love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37-39).

Love fulfills the law (Romans 13:10). Sanctification is learning to love rightly.

## The Role of Suffering in Sanctification

**Why does God allow believers to suffer?**

**Romans 5:3-4:** "We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope."

**James 1:2-4:** "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."

**Hebrews 12:10-11:** "He disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."

**Suffering is a tool of sanctification.** It:
- Reveals remaining sin.
- Teaches dependence on God.
- Produces endurance.
- Conforms us to Christ (who suffered).

**1 Peter 4:1:** "Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin."

Suffering breaks the power of sin. It weakens our attachment to the world and strengthens our longing for God.

## Sanctification and Assurance

**If sanctification is progressive, how do I know I'm actually saved?**

**1 John 3:14:** "We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers."

**Evidence of sanctification** (growing in love, obedience, fruit of the Spirit) confirms that justification occurred.

**But what if I'm not seeing enough growth?**

**Philippians 1:6:** "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion."

God will finish what He started. If you're genuinely saved, sanctification *will* happen—maybe slowly, but surely.

**The danger:**

Don't base assurance on your performance. Look to Christ. He's the guarantee, not your progress.

**But also:**

If there's no fruit whatsoever, no evidence of change, question whether genuine faith exists.

**1 John 2:3-4:** "By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says 'I know him' but does not keep his commandments is a liar."

Saving faith produces obedience. Not perfect obedience, but real obedience.

## Hebrew Perspective: Covenant Faithfulness

Sanctification in the Greek framework is about moral transformation.

In the Hebrew framework, it's about covenant faithfulness—living as God's set-apart people.

**Leviticus 20:26:** "You shall be holy to me, for I the LORD am holy and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine."

Holiness is relational, not just moral. Israel is holy because they belong to YHWH. Their distinctiveness reflects His claim on them.

**Sanctification as identity:**

You're God's child. Live like it.

You're part of His covenant people. Embody the family resemblance.

**Deuteronomy 7:6:** "For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession."

The *status* (set apart, treasured) grounds the *call* (be holy).

**Same pattern in NT:**

**1 Peter 2:9:** "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."

You *are* holy (definitive sanctification). Therefore, *be* holy (progressive sanctification).

**The Hebrew lens softens the individualism.** Sanctification isn't just "me becoming holy." It's "us, the covenant community, embodying God's character together."

## Both/And: Transformation and Covenant Identity

Sanctification is both:
- **Greek:** Moral transformation by the Spirit, conformity to Christ's image.
- **Hebrew:** Covenant faithfulness, living out our identity as God's people.

The Spirit transforms us. The law guides us. Suffering refines us. Community supports us. [Grace](#salvation/grace 'Hebrew') sustains us.

And one day, the struggle will end. We'll be fully, finally, perfectly holy—when Christ returns and completes what He began.

Until then: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you" (Philippians 2:12-13).
