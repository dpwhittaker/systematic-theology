*Coming back* to God—repentance as turning around and returning home.

Hebrew: *Teshuva* (תשובה)—return, repentance. Not just feeling sorry, but turning back to [covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew') relationship.

Greek: *Metanoia* (μετάνοια)—change of mind. But in Hebrew thought, it's deeper than mental—it's relational restoration.

The prodigal son returns home (Luke 15). Israel returns from exile. The sinner returns to God. Repentance as homecoming.

# Teshuva: The Journey Home

The Hebrew word for repentance is *teshuva* (תשובה)—literally "return."

Not: "I feel bad about what I did."

But: "I'm turning around and coming back."

**Hosea 6:1:** "Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up."

Repentance is movement—from alienation to relationship, from exile to home.

## The Meaning of Teshuva

### Hebrew: *Shuv* (שוב)

**To turn, to return, to go back.**

**2 Chronicles 7:14:** "If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land."

**Turn from** (wicked ways) and **turn to** (God's face).

**Jeremiah 3:12-14:** "'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD... 'Return, O faithless children,' declares the LORD; 'for I am your master.'"

God calls Israel back. Repentance is response to His invitation.

**Joel 2:12-13:** "Yet even now," declares the LORD, "return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and merciful."

Return involves the whole heart—emotion, will, action.

### Greek: *Metanoia* (μετάνοια)

**Change of mind, repentance.**

Meta = change. Noia = mind.

**Acts 3:19:** "Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out."

**Luke 13:3:** "Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."

Jesus preaches repentance. It's the prerequisite for entering the kingdom.

**Matthew 3:2:** "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (John the Baptist's message).

**Mark 1:15:** "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel" (Jesus' message).

**The Greek captures the mental shift:** Changing how you think about sin, self, and God.

**The Hebrew captures the relational movement:** Turning from rebellion, returning to [covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew').

## Repentance in the Old Testament: The Exile Pattern

Israel's history is a cycle of sin, exile, and return.

### The Pattern

**1. Sin:** Israel breaks covenant—idolatry, injustice, disobedience.

**2. Exile:** God judges—removing His presence, sending them into foreign lands.

**3. Call to return:** Prophets plead, "Come back to the LORD."

**4. Teshuva:** Israel repents, cries out to God.

**5. Restoration:** God brings them home, renews the covenant.

### Examples

**Judges:** Israel sins → God gives them over to enemies → They cry out → God sends a deliverer → Peace. Repeat cycle.

**Babylonian exile:**
- **Sin:** Judah worships idols, ignores the prophets (Jeremiah, Isaiah).
- **Exile:** Babylon destroys Jerusalem, exiles the people (586 BC).
- **Call to return:** Jeremiah promises restoration (Jeremiah 29:10-14).
- **Teshuva:** The people repent in exile (Daniel 9).
- **Restoration:** God brings them back under Ezra and Nehemiah (538 BC onward).

**The theological meaning:**

Sin is exile—separation from God's presence.

Repentance is return—coming back to relationship.

[Redemption](#salvation/redemption 'Hebrew') is God's act of bringing us home.

## Teshuva: The Components

Jewish tradition identifies several elements of genuine repentance.

### 1. Recognition of Sin (*Hakarat HaChet*)

**You must acknowledge that you sinned.**

**Psalm 51:3-4:** "For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight."

David confesses. No excuses, no blame-shifting.

**Proverbs 28:13:** "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."

Recognition is the first step. You can't return if you don't admit you left.

### 2. Regret (*Charata*)

**Genuine sorrow over sin.**

**2 Corinthians 7:10:** "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death."

**Godly grief:** Sorrow over offending God.

**Worldly grief:** Sorrow over getting caught or facing consequences.

**Psalm 51:17:** "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise."

God desires contrition—a heart genuinely grieved by sin.

### 3. Confession (*Vidui*)

**Verbally confessing sin to God.**

**1 John 1:9:** "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

**Psalm 32:5:** "I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,' and you forgave the iniquity of my sin."

Confession externalizes the internal recognition and regret. It's speaking the truth about ourselves to God.

### 4. Forsaking Sin (*Azivat HaChet*)

**Repentance requires turning away from the sin.**

**Proverbs 28:13:** "He who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."

Not just "I'm sorry," but "I'm stopping."

**Isaiah 55:7:** "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him."

Forsake *and* return. Negative (stop sinning) and positive (turn to God).

**Ezekiel 18:30-31:** "Repent and turn from all your transgressions... Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit!"

Action follows repentance. You change direction.

### 5. Restitution (*Tashlumin*)

**If possible, make amends for the harm caused.**

**Luke 19:8:** Zacchaeus says, "If I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold."

Jesus responds: "Today salvation has come to this house."

Restitution proves repentance is genuine. You undo the damage where you can.

**Leviticus 6:4-5:** If you steal or deceive, "he shall restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it."

Repentance isn't just vertical (toward God) but horizontal (toward people harmed).

### 6. Commitment Not to Repeat (*Kabbalah al HaAtid*)

**Resolving not to sin again.**

**Romans 6:1-2:** "What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that [grace](#salvation/grace 'Hebrew') may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?"

Repentance includes intention: "I won't go back."

**Maimonides (Jewish philosopher):** True repentance is proven when you're in the same situation again and you *don't* sin.

If you would repeat the sin given the chance, you haven't truly repented.

## The Prodigal Son: The Parable of Return

**Luke 15:11-32:** Jesus tells the story of a son who leaves, squanders his inheritance, and returns home.

### The Departure (Sin)

**Luke 15:12-13:** "The younger son... squandered his property in reckless living."

He demanded his inheritance (treating his father as if dead) and left.

**This is sin:** Rebellion, autonomy, rejecting the father's authority.

### The Far Country (Exile)

**Luke 15:14-16:** Famine comes. He's starving, feeding pigs, longing to eat pig food.

**The low point:** He's alienated, destitute, degraded (feeding pigs—unclean for a Jew).

**This is the consequence of sin:** Exile from the father's house, slavery to lesser things.

### The Turning Point (Teshuva Begins)

**Luke 15:17:** "But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!'"

**Recognition:** "I'm in the wrong place. I need to return."

### The Return (Repentance)

**Luke 15:18-20:** "I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.' And he arose and came to his father."

**All the elements of teshuva:**
1. **Recognition:** "I have sinned."
2. **Regret:** (Implied in his confession.)
3. **Confession:** "I will say to him..."
4. **Forsaking sin:** "I will arise and go." He leaves the far country.
5. **Restitution:** (Not possible—he squandered it—but he's willing to serve as a hired hand.)
6. **Commitment:** He goes back intending to change.

### The Father's Response (God's Grace)

**Luke 15:20:** "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him."

The father doesn't wait passively. He sees, runs, embraces.

**This is God's heart toward the repentant.**

**Luke 15:22-24:** "Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found."

**Restoration:**
- Robe: Status as son (not servant).
- Ring: Authority.
- Shoes: Freedom (slaves went barefoot).
- Feast: Celebration.

**The son hoped to be a servant. The father restores him as son.**

**This is the gospel of teshuva:** We return as rebels. God welcomes us as children.

## Return from Exile: The Prophetic Hope

The prophets promise that God will bring Israel back from exile.

### Physical Return

**Jeremiah 29:10-14:** "When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place... You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations."

God will bring them back geographically—from Babylon to Jerusalem.

**This happened:** Ezra, Nehemiah, rebuilding the temple.

### Spiritual Return

But the prophets also promise a deeper return—heart transformation.

**Ezekiel 36:25-27:** "I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses... And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes."

God will change the heart. Teshuva won't just be external (returning to the land) but internal (returning to covenant faithfulness).

**Jeremiah 31:31-33:** "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel... I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts."

The New Covenant: God writes His law on hearts. Obedience flows from transformed desires, not external compulsion.

**This is fulfilled in Christ:** The Spirit given at Pentecost (Acts 2). Hearts regenerated. [Sanctification](#salvation/sanctification 'Greek') as progressive teshuva—continual return to God.

## Repentance and the Kingdom

**Jesus' first message:** Repent, for the kingdom is at hand (Matthew 4:17).

**Why repentance?**

The kingdom requires citizens whose hearts align with the King. You can't enter God's kingdom while living in rebellion.

**Luke 13:3, 5:** "Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."

Repentance is the gateway to salvation.

**Acts 2:38:** "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

Peter's call after Pentecost: Turn back to God through Jesus.

**Acts 17:30:** "The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent."

Universal command. Everyone must return to God.

## Repentance and Faith

Are repentance and [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill') the same, or different?

### Two Sides of the Same Coin

**Mark 1:15:** "Repent and believe in the gospel."

**Acts 20:21:** "Testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."

**Repentance:** Turning *from* sin.

**Faith:** Turning *to* Christ.

**You can't do one without the other.**

You can't trust Christ while clinging to sin. And you can't genuinely forsake sin without trusting Christ for forgiveness and power.

**Teshuva includes both:** Return *from* rebellion, return *to* God.

### Ongoing Repentance

**Is repentance a one-time event (conversion) or ongoing?**

**Both.**

**Initial repentance:** At conversion, you turn from sin to Christ. Decisive break with the old life.

**Continual repentance:** Throughout life, you keep returning to God when you drift.

**1 John 1:8-9:** "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves... If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us."

Even believers sin. We need ongoing confession and repentance.

**Martin Luther (95 Theses, #1):** "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, 'Repent,' he intended that the entire life of believers should be repentance."

Repentance is not just the entry point. It's the lifestyle.

## Repentance Without Fruit?

**Matthew 3:8:** "Bear fruit in keeping with repentance."

John the Baptist warns: Don't just say you repent. Prove it.

**Luke 3:10-14:** The crowds ask, "What then shall we do?"

John answers:
- Share with the needy.
- Tax collectors: Don't extort.
- Soldiers: Don't abuse power.

**Repentance changes behavior.** If there's no fruit, the repentance is false.

**James 2:17:** "Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."

Similarly: Repentance by itself, if it doesn't produce change, is empty.

## Cheap Repentance vs. True Teshuva

### Cheap Repentance (Worldly Grief)

**2 Corinthians 7:10:** "Worldly grief produces death."

**Worldly grief:**
- Sorrow over getting caught, not over the sin itself.
- Regret over consequences, not over offending God.
- Confession without change.

**Example:** King Saul (1 Samuel 15). When confronted, he says "I have sinned" (v. 24), but he's more concerned about his reputation (v. 30: "honor me before the people") than restoring relationship with God.

### True Teshuva (Godly Grief)

**2 Corinthians 7:10:** "Godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret."

**Godly grief:**
- Sorrow over offending God.
- Brokenness over your sin's ugliness.
- Leads to genuine change.

**Example:** King David (Psalm 51). When confronted, he confesses, "Against you, you only, have I sinned" (v. 4). He asks for a clean heart (v. 10). He's genuinely broken.

**The difference:** Saul wanted to preserve his reputation. David wanted to restore relationship with God.

## God's Delight in Teshuva

**Ezekiel 18:23:** "Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?"

**Ezekiel 33:11:** "As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?"

God pleads. He *wants* us to return.

**Luke 15:7:** "There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance."

Heaven rejoices when one sinner comes home.

**Luke 15:10:** "There is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

Your teshuva brings joy to God and His angels.

## The Call to Return

**Isaiah 55:6-7:** "Seek the LORD while he may be found; call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."

**Joel 2:12-13:** "Return to me with all your heart... Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love."

**Hosea 14:1-2:** "Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity. Take with you words and return to the LORD; say to him, 'Take away all iniquity; accept what is good, and we will pay with the fruit of our lips.'"

**The invitation stands:** Come back.

No matter how far you've wandered. No matter what you've done. The Father is watching, ready to run toward you when you turn homeward.

## Teshuva and the Cross

**How does Christ's death enable teshuva?**

**1. It removes the barrier (guilt).**

We can't approach God while guilty. The cross pays the penalty, so we can return without condemnation.

**Romans 8:1:** "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."

**2. It demonstrates God's love.**

We might fear returning—what if God rejects us? The cross shows He welcomes us.

**Romans 5:8:** "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

**3. It provides power to change.**

Repentance isn't just sorrow. It's transformation. The Spirit (given because of Christ's work) empowers us to forsake sin.

**Titus 2:11-12:** "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions."

**The cross makes teshuva possible:** Forgiveness available, love demonstrated, power supplied.

## The Final Return: Glorification

Teshuva is the journey home. [Glorification](#salvation/glorification 'Greek') is arrival.

**Revelation 21:3-4:** "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more."

The exile ends. God dwells with His people forever.

**This is the ultimate return:** From the far country (sin, death, alienation) to the Father's house (new creation, resurrection, eternal fellowship).

Teshuva now is the first step on the road home. Glorification is walking through the door and sitting at the feast.

## Hebrew Intimacy: Coming Home, Not Just Getting Pardoned

**Greek framework:** Repentance leads to [justification](#salvation/justification 'Greek')—legal pardon, guilt removed.

**Hebrew framework:** Teshuva is return—relational restoration, exile ended.

**Both are true.** But the Hebrew lens adds warmth.

You're not just acquitted in court. You're welcomed home by a Father who's been watching the road, waiting for your return.

"This my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found" (Luke 15:24).

Return. The Father is waiting.
