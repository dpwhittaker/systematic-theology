title: Theology as Struggle

[Intro](#intro/intro 'Parent')

*Yisrael* - "one who strives with God."
Theology is not a destination but a [journey](#intro/story 'Hebrew').
Truth emerges through [wrestling](#intro/wrestling 'Hebrew'), not passive study.

The Hebrew model: theology is *work*. Active, exhausting, transformative work. Not the work of organizing facts, but the work of engaging a living God through a living text.

Jewish study (*Talmud Torah*) happens in pairs—*chavruta*—two students arguing, challenging, pushing each other deeper. The goal is not agreement but sharpened understanding. Iron sharpens iron. The clash itself produces light.

Each generation must struggle with the text anew. What did it mean *then*? What does it mean *now*? How do we live it *today*? The answers aren't simply inherited—they must be earned through serious engagement.

This is why Jewish tradition values questions over answers. A good question opens new pathways. A final answer closes them. The greatest sages are known for their questions: *kashe*—"difficulty, hard question"—becomes a compliment. "Reb Akiva's *kashe*..." means he saw something others missed.

Compare: Systematic theology aims for *resolution*. Build the system, answer the questions, achieve doctrinal clarity. The goal is a stable structure, internally consistent, able to answer objections. The emphasis is on *completion*.

But what if the text resists completion? What if God prefers questions to conclusions? What if the struggle itself is the relationship?

Hebrew tradition doesn't fear interpretive tension. The Written Torah and Oral Torah exist in creative friction. Shammai and Hillel disagree on almost everything—and both are preserved as holy teaching. *Eilu v'eilu*—both are words of the living God.

When we systematize, do we lose this creative tension? Do we trade the living struggle for dead certainty?
