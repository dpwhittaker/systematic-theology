Theology is not a destination but a [journey](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew').
Truth emerges through wrestling, not passive study.
This is the Hebrew model for [engaging](#intro/relation 'Hebrew') Scripture.

*Vayei'avek*—"and he wrestled." Genesis 32. Jacob at the Jabbok river, alone in the dark, grappling with a mysterious figure until dawn. He doesn't ask "What are you?" but demands "Bless me!" He emerges limping but renamed: *Yisrael*—"one who strives with God."

This is the paradigm for Jewish engagement with Torah. Not passive reception, but active struggle. The rabbis don't just *read* Scripture—they wrestle it, question it, argue with it, turn it over and over seeking every angle.

# Theology as Work

The Hebrew model: theology is *work*. Active, exhausting, transformative work. Not the work of organizing facts, but the work of engaging a living God through a living text.

Jewish study (*Talmud Torah*) happens in pairs—*chavruta*—two students arguing, challenging, pushing each other deeper. The goal is not agreement but sharpened understanding. Iron sharpens iron. The clash itself produces light.

Each generation must struggle with the text anew. What did it mean *then*? What does it mean *now*? How do we live it *today*? The answers aren't simply inherited—they must be earned through serious engagement.

This is why Jewish tradition values questions over answers. A good question opens new pathways. A final answer closes them. The greatest sages are known for their questions: *kashe*—"difficulty, hard question"—becomes a compliment. "Reb Akiva's *kashe*..." means he saw something others missed.

# The Divine Argument

The Talmud records fierce debates: Rabbi Eliezer vs. Rabbi Joshua, dispute after dispute. When a heavenly voice declares Eliezer correct, Joshua replies: "The Torah is not in heaven! We decide by majority vote." And God laughs with delight, saying "My children have defeated me!"

This is *not* irreverence—it's the highest form of engagement. Wrestling requires both parties to be real. You can't wrestle an [abstraction](#intro/philosophy 'Greek'). You can't argue with a formula. The text must be alive, God must be present, for the struggle to mean anything.

Hebrew tradition doesn't fear interpretive tension. The Written Torah and Oral Torah exist in creative friction. Shammai and Hillel disagree on almost everything—and both are preserved as holy teaching. *Eilu v'eilu*—both are words of the living God.

# The Lion's Growl

*Hagah* (הָגָה)—the Hebrew word for meditation—carries a striking image. The same word describes a lion growling over its prey (Isaiah 31:4). When the Psalms command us to "meditate on His law day and night" (Psalm 1:2), the word is *hagah*: to mutter, to murmur, to make low repetitive sounds—like a lion growling possessively over its kill.

This is not quiet, detached reflection. It's active, audible, repetitive engagement. The lion doesn't abandon its prey to hunt something else—it stays, guards, returns again and again. It doesn't consume everything at once but chews slowly, deliberately, extracting every bit of sustenance.

Ancient Jewish practice reflects this: students rocking back and forth, repeating verses aloud, returning to the same passage day after day. Not to memorize facts but to *internalize* truth. Not to master the text but to let the text master *you*.

The image confronts our modern assumption that "study" means silent reading, quick comprehension, moving on. *Hagah* says: Stay. Growl over this. Don't let go. Return tomorrow and growl again.

# Contrast with System

Compare: Systematic theology aims for *resolution*—not to "kill" the text, but to ensure we're not affirming contradictions.

If God cannot lie (Titus 1:2), then apparent contradictions in revelation must be reconciled, or one side reconsidered. To say "God is both just and unjust" in the same sense violates His character.

Greek philosophy values consistency because contradictions undermine truth. If A and not-A are both affirmed, nothing is affirmed—we've descended into incoherence where words mean nothing.

Hebrew thought embraces *paradox*—apparent contradictions that reveal truth's complexity. God's sovereignty and human responsibility appear contradictory but are both biblically affirmed. This is paradox, not contradiction—mystery, not incoherence.

But does Hebrew thought embrace actual *contradiction*? When Hillel and Shammai give opposite rulings, can both be fully implemented simultaneously? No—one must be followed in practice (the law follows Hillel).

*Eilu v'eilu* ("these and these are words of the living God") may mean: Both perspectives see part of the truth. Both approaches have merit. Both honor God's word. Not: Logic itself is transcended and contradictions are affirmed.

## The Dangers of Each Approach

**The danger of systematization:** Freezing living truth into static formulas, losing personal encounter for abstract propositions, answering questions the text doesn't ask.

**The danger of pure paradox:** Allowing incoherence in the name of mystery, making truth claims that can mean anything and therefore mean nothing, avoiding the hard work of reconciliation.

**The value of resolution:** Confident assurance enables mission. "I know whom I have believed" (2 Timothy 1:12). Resolution isn't arrogance—it's trust in a God who speaks clearly enough to be understood.

**The value of wrestling:** Humble acknowledgment that finite minds grasp infinite truth imperfectly. The relationship with God matters more than winning arguments about Him.

Can we pursue both clarity AND humility? Systematic coherence AND wrestling with mystery? Confident assurance AND humble acknowledgment of what remains beyond our grasp?

Perhaps the question isn't resolution OR tension, but how to hold both: the confidence to declare "Jesus is Lord" with the humility to say "His ways are higher than our ways."
