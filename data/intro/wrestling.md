*Vayei'avek*—"and he wrestled." Genesis 32. Jacob at the Jabbok river, alone in the dark, grappling with a mysterious figure until dawn. He doesn't ask "What are you?" but demands "Bless me!" He emerges limping but renamed: *Yisrael*—"one who strives with God."

This is the paradigm for Jewish engagement with Torah. Not passive reception, but active struggle. The rabbis don't just *read* Scripture—they wrestle it, question it, argue with it, turn it over and over seeking every angle.

## Theology as Work

The Hebrew model: theology is *work*. Active, exhausting, transformative work. Not the work of organizing facts, but the work of engaging a living God through a living text.

Jewish study (*Talmud Torah*) happens in pairs—*chavruta*—two students arguing, challenging, pushing each other deeper. The goal is not agreement but sharpened understanding. Iron sharpens iron. The clash itself produces light.

Each generation must struggle with the text anew. What did it mean *then*? What does it mean *now*? How do we live it *today*? The answers aren't simply inherited—they must be earned through serious engagement.

This is why Jewish tradition values questions over answers. A good question opens new pathways. A final answer closes them. The greatest sages are known for their questions: *kashe*—"difficulty, hard question"—becomes a compliment. "Reb Akiva's *kashe*..." means he saw something others missed.

## The Divine Argument

The Talmud records fierce debates: Rabbi Eliezer vs. Rabbi Joshua, dispute after dispute. When a heavenly voice declares Eliezer correct, Joshua replies: "The Torah is not in heaven! We decide by majority vote." And God laughs with delight, saying "My children have defeated me!"

This is *not* irreverence—it's the highest form of engagement. Wrestling requires both parties to be real. You can't wrestle an [abstraction](#intro/abstraction 'Greek'). You can't argue with a formula. The text must be alive, God must be present, for the struggle to mean anything.

Hebrew tradition doesn't fear interpretive tension. The Written Torah and Oral Torah exist in creative friction. Shammai and Hillel disagree on almost everything—and both are preserved as holy teaching. *Eilu v'eilu*—both are words of the living God.

## Contrast with System

Compare: Systematic theology aims for *resolution*. Build the [system](#intro/system 'Greek'), answer the questions, achieve doctrinal clarity. The goal is a stable structure, internally consistent, able to answer objections. The emphasis is on *completion*.

Greek philosophy seeks to resolve contradictions, achieve consistency, arrive at clear definitions. The goal is *closure*. Hebrew thought embraces the struggle itself as the point. Multiple interpretations, ongoing argument, questions that generate more questions—this is not failure to reach truth, but faithfulness to a God who cannot be contained.

But what if the text resists completion? What if God prefers questions to conclusions? What if the struggle itself is the relationship?

When systematic theology demands one right answer, does it trade wrestling for winning? Do we lose this creative tension? Do we trade the living struggle for dead certainty? Does it silence the argument God delights to hear?
