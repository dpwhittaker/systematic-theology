Jacob [wrestled](#intro/struggle 'Drill') with God and would not let go until blessed.
Israel means "one who strives with God."
This is the Hebrew model for [engaging](#intro/relation 'Hebrew') Scripture.

*Vayei'avek*—"and he wrestled." Genesis 32. Jacob at the Jabbok river, alone in the dark, grappling with a mysterious figure until dawn. He doesn't ask "What are you?" but demands "Bless me!" He emerges limping but renamed: *Yisrael*—"one who strives with God."

This is the paradigm for Jewish engagement with Torah. Not passive reception, but active struggle. The rabbis don't just *read* Scripture—they wrestle it, question it, argue with it, turn it over and over seeking every angle.

The Talmud records fierce debates: Rabbi Eliezer vs. Rabbi Joshua, dispute after dispute. When a heavenly voice declares Eliezer correct, Joshua replies: "The Torah is not in heaven! We decide by majority vote." And God laughs with delight, saying "My children have defeated me!"

This is *not* irreverence—it's the highest form of engagement. Wrestling requires both parties to be real. You can't wrestle an abstraction. You can't argue with a formula. The text must be alive, God must be present, for the struggle to mean anything.

Contrast: Greek philosophy seeks to resolve contradictions, achieve consistency, arrive at clear definitions. The goal is *closure*. Hebrew thought embraces the struggle itself as the point. Multiple interpretations, ongoing argument, questions that generate more questions—this is not failure to reach truth, but faithfulness to a God who cannot be contained.

When systematic theology demands one right answer, does it trade wrestling for winning? Does it silence the argument God delights to hear?
