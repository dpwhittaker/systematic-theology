[Intro](#intro/intro 'Parent')

Hebrew thought values *connection* over isolation.
God is known through [covenant](#salvation/covenant 'Hebrew'), not *abstract thought*.
Identity comes from *belonging*, not individual essence.
---
Theology as *relationship*, not information. The Hebrew Scriptures don't ask "What is God?" but "Who is God *to us*?" The question is relational from the start.

Israel's identity: "We are the people God brought out of Egypt." Not "We are humans with souls," but "We are the ones He chose, delivered, made promises to."

Names matter because they encode relationships. God reveals Himself as "I AM WHO I AM" (*Ehyeh asher ehyeh*)—presence, not definition. Later: "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Not a list of attributes, but a history of encounters.

Knowledge comes through engagement. You don't *know* God by studying Him from a distance—you know Him by [walking](#intro/wrestling 'Hebrew') with Him, [arguing](#intro/wrestling 'Hebrew') with Him, obeying and rebelling and returning. Like a marriage, not a thesis.

Greek philosophy seeks truth through detached observation. Hebrew faith seeks truth through covenant faithfulness. One says "step back to see clearly." The other says "step in to truly know."

Can systematic theology—built on Greek foundations—capture a faith rooted in relationship?
