Systematic theology organizes beliefs into [categories](#TOC 'Drill'): God, Christ, salvation, church.
It assumes truth can be systematized—but does Greek *logic* distort Hebrew *revelation*?
Can we organize the Bible without changing its *message*?

Greek thinking favors [Abstraction](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') & [Definition](#intro/philosophy 'Greek').
Hebrew thinking favors [Narrative](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew') & [Relation](#intro/relation 'Hebrew').

The risk: Making Scripture fit *our* framework instead of God's.
Explore the Hebrew approach: [Wrestling](#intro/wrestling 'Hebrew') with God, truth through encounter.

The central inquiry: Does systematizing theology impose a foreign structure on Scripture?

Systematic theology organizes doctrine into neat categories—God, humanity, sin, salvation. This assumes truth can be captured in logical propositions and arranged like a filing system. The Greeks sought universal truths through categorization and abstraction. The Hebrews revealed God through narrative, covenant, and relationship. Can we reconcile these approaches?

The danger is not *that* we organize, but *how*. If the organizational method itself comes from Greek philosophy, does it reshape the content? Can Hebrew revelation—intrinsically relational, narrative, covenant-focused—survive translation into Greek categories without losing something essential?

# Two Ways of Knowing

When Plato wanted to understand *justice*, he abstracted from particular cases to define the eternal Form of Justice. When Moses wanted to understand God, he asked to see His glory—and God showed him His *back*, His *effects*, His *passing by*. One seeks the universal through reason; the other encounters the particular through relationship.

These are not just different *topics*—they are different *ways of thinking*. Greek philosophy prizes clarity, consistency, system. Hebrew faith embraces mystery, paradox, story. The tension runs deeper than we usually acknowledge.

Consider: The Bible never defines the "Trinity." It shows the Father speaking, the Spirit hovering, the Son incarnate—and leaves us to wrestle with what it means. The church, influenced by Greek thought, spent centuries crafting precise formulations: *homoousios*, three "persons" (hypostases), one "substance" (ousia).

Was this necessary? The Bible speaks of Father, Son, and Spirit of God—relational and functional terms. Did Greek philosophy improve on this? Or did we trade the encounter for the explanation?

The Hebrew approach doesn't reject thinking—it rejects thinking *instead of* relationship. Study is holy, but study for the sake of *living* the text, not mastering it. You don't stand over Scripture, analyzing it; you stand under it, letting it interrogate *you*.

This site explores both approaches, resisting neither, romanticizing neither. The question is not which is *right*, but what each reveals and what each obscures. And whether Christian theology, inheriting both traditions, has the resources to hold them together.
