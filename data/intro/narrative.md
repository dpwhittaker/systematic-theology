title: Narrative Theology
---
[Intro](#intro/intro 'Parent')
---
Truth conveyed through *story*, not formula.
The Bible tells what God *did*, not just what He *is*.
[Events](#intro/events 'Drill') carry meaning that [propositions](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') cannot capture.

Story over proposition.
God reveals Himself through events, not [definitions](#intro/philosophy 'Greek').
The Bible is a *grand narrative*, not a textbook.

In Hebrew thought, theology happens *through* story. The Torah doesn't define God—it shows Him acting: creating, calling, delivering, judging, redeeming.

Jewish interpretation (*midrash*, *haggadah*) retells and re-imagines these stories for each generation. The text is alive, speaking now, not just then. Rabbis [wrestle](#intro/wrestling 'Hebrew') with Scripture like Jacob wrestled the angel—struggling, demanding blessing, emerging changed.

This is not a search for *final answers* but an ongoing [relationship](#intro/relation 'Hebrew') with a living text. Multiple interpretations can coexist. *Eilu v'eilu*—"These and these are both the words of the living God."

Contrast this with systematic theology's impulse to *extract propositions*, build *consistent doctrines*, and create *definitive statements*. The Greek mind wants permanence; the Hebrew mind expects movement.

When we organize truth into timeless categories, do we freeze what was meant to flow? Do we trade *encounter* for *encyclopedia*?
