title: Greek Philosophy: The Three-Step Method
---
[Intro](#intro/intro 'Parent')
---
Greek philosophy operates in three steps:
1. *Abstract* a thing to its essence—remove context, find what's universal.
2. State *propositions* about that essence—timeless, logical claims.
3. *Validate* those propositions by comparing to instances.

Hebrew thought asks different questions: What does it DO? How does it *relate*?
Greek: "God is love" (timeless proposition). Hebrew: "God loved Jacob" (historical [event](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew')).
One captures essence; the other captures [encounter](#intro/relation 'Hebrew').

# The Quest for Essence

Greek philosophy, particularly from Plato and Aristotle, introduced a way of thinking fundamentally different from the Hebrew mind. Where Hebrew thought moved through *story*, Greek thought moved through *definition*. Where Hebrew revelation came through God's *actions* in history, Greek wisdom came through contemplation of eternal *being*.

The central question: *What IS a thing?* Not what does it do, not how does it relate, but what is its fundamental nature—its *essence*—that makes it what it is and not something else?

# Plato's Forms

For Plato, the physical world is a shadow. True reality exists in the realm of *Forms*—perfect, eternal, unchanging templates. The chair you sit on is imperfect, temporary. But somewhere "beyond" exists the *Form of Chair*—the perfect, eternal essence of "chairness" that all physical chairs imperfectly copy.

This is *abstraction*: stripping away the particular to reach the universal. Every horse you see differs—color, size, temperament. But abstract away these particulars, and you arrive at the *Form of Horse*—what all horses share, what makes a horse a horse.

This method yields knowledge that is:
- **Universal**: True for all instances, everywhere, always
- **Eternal**: Unchanging across time
- **Necessary**: Cannot be otherwise
- **Contextless**: Independent of circumstance, history, relationship

# Aristotle's Essence

Aristotle modified Plato but kept the core move. He rejected separate Forms but retained *essence* as the defining characteristic. A thing's essence is what it *must* have to be that kind of thing. Humans are "rational animals"—rationality is essential, two legs is accidental (you're still human with one leg).

This leads to *definition*: capturing essence in precise language. A good definition states necessary and sufficient conditions. "Man is a rational animal" attempts to say exactly what human nature *is*, stripped of all non-essential traits.

# The Three-Step Method

Greek philosophy follows a systematic process:

## Step 1: Abstract to Essence

Strip away particular instances to find the universal form. Every human differs, but all share *human nature*. Every triangle differs, but all share *triangularity*. This is the move from "these horses" to "horseness," from "these acts of love" to "Love itself."

## Step 2: State Propositions

Once you have the essence, make *claims* about it. Propositions are timeless, logical statements:
- "God is immutable"
- "God is love"
- "Man is a rational animal"

These are not descriptions of *events* but definitions of *being*. Not "God loved the world" (historical) but "God is love" (eternal). Not "Jesus wept" (particular) but "God is impassible" (universal).

Propositional truth seeks statements that are:
- **Timeless**: True always, not just in one moment
- **Universal**: True everywhere, not just in one context
- **Logical**: Follows from other truths by reason
- **Testable**: Can be verified against instances

## Step 3: Validate Propositions

Test your propositions against reality. If you claim "All swans are white," observe swans. If you claim "God is immutable," examine Scripture and experience. Do the instances confirm the proposition?

This is the scientific method's ancestor: hypothesize about essence, state claims, test against data.

## Propositional vs Narrative Truth

The Greek method produces *propositions*—statements abstracted from history. The Hebrew method preserves *narrative*—truth embedded in events.

Compare:
- **Greek**: "God is love" (proposition about God's essence)
- **Hebrew**: "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son" (John 3:16—event in history)

The proposition is *timeless*—it's always true, everywhere. The narrative is *particular*—it happened once, in a specific time and place.

Systematic theology tends to extract propositions from narrative:
- Read: "God delivered Israel from Egypt"
- Extract: "God is a deliverer" (proposition)
- Categorize: Add to list of God's attributes

But the Hebrew mind resists this move. The *story* is the truth. God didn't deliver Israel to *illustrate* that He's a deliverer. He delivered Israel because He loved them, called them, made promises to Abraham. The particular act reveals His character more fully than any abstract proposition could.

When we reduce "God loved Jacob" to "God is love," we gain universality but lose particularity. We can now apply "God is love" to all people, all times. But we've left behind the specific, scandalous, inexplicable reality: God chose Jacob over Esau. God loved *this* person in *this* way at *this* moment.

Propositional truth asks: What is always true? Narrative truth asks: What actually happened? Both matter. But which comes first?

# The Theological Turn

When early Christian theologians—trained in Greek philosophy—turned to describe God, they brought these tools:

- What IS God's *essence*?
- What are His *essential attributes*?
- How do we *define* the divine nature?

Thus we get formulations like:
- God is *simple* (has no parts)
- God is *immutable* (does not change)
- God is *impassible* (does not experience emotion)
- God is *eternal* (outside time)

These are attempts to state God's *essence*—what He IS, apart from what He does.

# What Remains Unexplored?

But here the Hebrew critique emerges: **What is lost when we reduce God to His essential characteristics?**

## The Personal Becomes Impersonal

Essence is a category for *things*, not *persons*. You can define a triangle's essence (three-sided polygon), but can you define your mother's? When you abstract away her particular acts, her specific words to *you*, her unique presence in *your* history—what remains?

A list of attributes? "Patient, kind, creative..." But these are categories, not *her*. The essence of personhood resists abstraction. Persons are known through *encounter*, not definition.

Scripture reveals God as supremely personal: "I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3:14). Not "I am the unmoved mover" or "I am pure actuality." When Moses asks *who* God is, God responds with a name tied to presence and action: "I will be with you."

## The Historical Becomes Timeless

Greek thought values the eternal over the temporal. Truth must be unchanging, always valid. But the God of Scripture acts *in history*:

- He calls Abraham at a specific time
- He delivers Israel from Egypt in a specific event
- He becomes incarnate in Jesus at a specific moment

These are not illustrations of timeless truths—they ARE the revelation. God's character is disclosed *through* these acts, not apart from them.

When we abstract God's essence from His historical acts, we risk inverting the revelation. We end up saying: "God's actions illustrate His pre-defined essence." But Scripture says: "God's essence is known *through* His actions."

## The Relational Becomes Categorical

Essence thinking prioritizes *what* over *who*. It asks: What kind of being is God? What category does He fit? What are His properties?

But Hebrew revelation is relational:
- "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (not "the God of philosophers")
- "I am your God; you are my people" (covenant language, not categorical)
- "As a father has compassion on his children..." (relational metaphor, not attribute list)

Relationship cannot be captured by definition. A father is not just "one who exhibits paternal attributes." He is *your* father—particular, irreducible, known through shared history.

When we reduce God to essential attributes, we can study Him without knowing Him. We can pass a theology exam without ever crying out "My God!" in either desperation or worship.

## The Dynamic Becomes Static

Greek essence is *static*—it doesn't change, develop, or respond. A triangle's essence is the same yesterday, today, forever. But God in Scripture:

- *Grieves* at human wickedness (Genesis 6:6)
- *Relents* from planned judgment (Exodus 32:14)
- *Rejoices* over His people (Zephaniah 3:17)
- *Wrestles* with Jacob (Genesis 32)

Are these just anthropomorphisms—human projections onto an unchanging essence? Or do they reveal a God who genuinely *engages*, who enters into dynamic relationship, whose actions are real responses, not pre-programmed outputs?

The doctrine of divine immutability (God does not change) protects important truths: God is not fickle, His character is reliable, His promises stand. But if pressed too far—if God's essence is utterly static—can He truly love? Love requires response, vulnerability, the freedom to be affected by the beloved.

## The Living Becomes Systematic

Ultimately, the question is: **Can a living God fit into the categories of Greek philosophy without ceasing to be the God who acts, speaks, covenants, suffers, and saves?**

The Hebrew model: God is known through *story*. Through His dealings with Israel. Through the Incarnation—where the eternal Word becomes flesh, enters history, suffers and dies. The Gospel is not a philosophical theorem but an announcement of events: "Christ died for our sins, was buried, was raised on the third day" (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

The Greek model: God is known through *contemplation* of His essence. His acts illustrate His nature, but the nature itself is grasped through philosophical reasoning about necessity, causation, perfection.

Can both be true? Can the God who IS (essence) also be the God who ACTS (event)? Can systematic theology honor both the eternal and the historical, the categorical and the personal, the defined and the encountered?

Or must we choose: Will we know God as *what* or as *Who*?
