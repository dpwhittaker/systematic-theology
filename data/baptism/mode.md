[Baptism](#baptism/baptism 'Parent')

How should baptism be administered? *Immersion*, *sprinkling*, or *pouring*?

**The Immersion Argument:**
- Greek *baptizo* means "to dip, plunge, immerse"
- John baptized "in the Jordan" and "where there was much water" (John 3:23)
- Jesus "came up out of the water" (Mark 1:10)
- Romans 6:4 - "buried with Him through baptism" (immersion pictures death/burial/resurrection)
- Early church practiced immersion (Didache, early baptisteries)

**The Sprinkling/Pouring Argument:**
- Old Testament uses sprinkling for ceremonial cleansing (Ezekiel 36:25)
- *Baptizo* can mean "to wash" more generally (Mark 7:4 - washing hands, cups)
- Practical in prison (Philippine jailer, Acts 16:33), sick rooms, desert climates
- Early church allowed pouring when immersion wasn't possible (Didache 7:3)

The division: Baptists, Churches of Christ, Orthodox demand [immersion](#baptism/mikveh 'Hebrew'). Most others permit sprinkling/pouring.

# The Lexical Debate

Does the Greek word *baptizo* settle it?

**Immersionists argue:**
The word itself means "to immerse, plunge, dip." Classical Greek uses it for ships sinking (being "baptized" in water), fabric being dyed (immersed in dye). When the New Testament uses *baptizo*, it inherently implies full immersion.

Proof texts:
- John 3:23 - "John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, *because there was much water there*"
- Mark 1:9-10 - Jesus was baptized "*in* the Jordan" and came up "*out of* the water"
- Acts 8:38-39 - Philip and the eunuch "went down into the water" and "came up out of the water"

**Sprinkling advocates respond:**
The word can mean "to wash" or "to cleanse" more broadly. Mark 7:4 uses *baptizo* for washing hands, cups, couches—not immersion but ritual washing. Luke 11:38 uses it for washing hands before dinner.

The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) uses related words for sprinkling blood, water. The concept of cleansing by water doesn't demand full immersion.

## The Symbolism Argument

**Immersion proponents:**
Romans 6:3-4 - "We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death, so that... we too might walk in newness of life."

Burial implies *going down into* and *coming up from*. You don't bury someone by sprinkling dirt on them. Immersion enacts the Gospel: death (going under), burial (submerged), resurrection (rising from water).

Colossians 2:12 - "buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith."

The physical act *pictures* the spiritual reality. Immersion is not arbitrary—it's sacramental in the truest sense: the sign *shows* what it signifies.

**Sprinkling advocates:**
The symbolism is cleansing, not burial. Ezekiel 36:25 - "I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean." Hebrews 10:22 - "bodies washed with pure water."

Baptism is the New Covenant fulfillment of Old Testament ritual washings—and those involved sprinkling (Leviticus 14:7, Numbers 8:7).

The mode matters less than the meaning: cleansing from sin, being set apart to God.

## Historical Practice

**Early Church Evidence:**

The *Didache* (late 1st/early 2nd century):
"Baptize in living [running] water. If you do not have living water, baptize in other water; if you cannot in cold, then in warm. If you have neither, pour water three times on the head in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."

This suggests:
1. Preference for immersion in running water (rivers, streams)
2. Permission for pouring when immersion isn't possible
3. Flexibility based on circumstances

Early baptisteries (3rd-4th century) were large enough for immersion but also show evidence of affusion (pouring).

**Medieval to Reformation:**
Western church gradually shifted to sprinkling/pouring, especially as infant baptism became universal. Fonts replaced baptisteries.

**Reformation responses:**
- Luther: Mode doesn't matter, though immersion best pictures the symbolism
- Calvin: Sprinkling is sufficient; obsessing over mode misses the point
- Anabaptists: Immersion is biblical and symbolically necessary

## Theological Implications

Why does this matter so much?

**For immersionists:**
The form is tied to the meaning. If baptism represents death/burial/resurrection, the mode isn't arbitrary—it's part of the message. Changing the mode distorts the Gospel picture.

Additionally: If the church can change baptism's mode, what else can it change? Guarding the apostolic practice guards the faith itself.

**For non-immersionists:**
Elevating mode to essential status is legalism. The Spirit's work, not the water's quantity or method, is what matters. Demanding immersion when Scripture allows flexibility is adding to God's Word.

Additionally: The early church itself permitted pouring. Insisting on one mode divides the church over a secondary issue.

## The Hebrew Perspective: Mikveh

Jewish ritual immersion (*mikveh*) provides background:
- Full-body immersion in "living water" (natural source or ritual bath)
- For purification from ceremonial uncleanness
- Required before entering temple, after menstruation, for conversion to Judaism

John's baptism drew on this tradition. Jews would recognize the act: going down into water, being cleansed, emerging renewed.

But John added *repentance*—not just ritual purity but moral transformation (Matthew 3:8).

Does this settle the mode question? Mikveh is immersion. But the New Testament church wasn't bound to replicate every detail of Jewish practice (see: circumcision, dietary laws, Sabbath).

## Can Both Be Valid?

Some attempt middle ground:
- Mode isn't *essential* to validity, but immersion is *preferable* for its rich symbolism
- Churches should accommodate those who in good conscience require immersion
- Unity around Christ is more important than uniformity in practice

Others see no compromise:
- Baptism is a *command*, not a suggestion—obedience matters
- The biblical pattern is immersion; departing from it is disobedience
- OR: The biblical pattern permits flexibility; demanding immersion is legalism

The division remains.
