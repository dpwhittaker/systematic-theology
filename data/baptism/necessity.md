[Baptism](#baptism/baptism 'Parent')

Must you be baptized to be saved? Christianity is sharply divided.

**Baptism is necessary:**
- "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved" (Mark 16:16)
- "Baptism now saves you" (1 Peter 3:21)
- "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God" (John 3:5)
- Held by: Church of Christ, some Catholics, Orthodox

**Baptism is not necessary:**
- "Whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16 - no baptism mentioned)
- The thief on the cross saved without baptism (Luke 23:43)
- Paul: "Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel" (1 Corinthians 1:17)
- Held by: Most Protestants (Baptist, Reformed, Pentecostal, etc.)

This is not a small disagreement. If baptism is necessary, millions of sincere believers who died unbaptized are lost. If it's not necessary, churches that teach it is are proclaiming a false gospel.

# The "Baptism is Necessary" Position

## Church of Christ Theology

The Churches of Christ (and related movements) hold the strongest position on baptismal necessity:

**Core claim:** Baptism is *when* and *where* God forgives sins, applies Christ's blood, and adds you to the church.

**Biblical basis:**

**Acts 2:38** - "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ *for the forgiveness of your sins*."

The Greek *eis* indicates purpose: baptism is *in order to obtain* forgiveness. You're not forgiven before baptism; you're forgiven *in* baptism.

**Acts 22:16** - "Rise and be baptized and *wash away your sins*, calling on His name."

Paul's sins weren't washed away on the Damascus road when he saw Jesus. They were washed away when Ananias baptized him. The moment of salvation is the moment of baptism.

**Mark 16:16** - "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."

Two requirements: believe *and* be baptized. Not believe *then* get baptized eventually. The two together bring salvation.

**1 Peter 3:21** - "Baptism... now saves you."

Not symbolizes salvation. *Saves you*. How much plainer could Scripture be?

**Galatians 3:27** - "As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."

You're not *in Christ* until you're *baptized into Christ*. Baptism is the dividing line between lost and saved.

**Romans 6:3-4** - "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? We were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death..."

You're united to Christ's death *in baptism*. That's when His blood is applied. Before baptism, you're still in your sins.

**The pattern in Acts:**

Every conversion follows the same sequence:
1. Hear the Gospel
2. Believe
3. Be baptized *immediately*
4. Now saved

Examples:
- **Acts 8:36-38** - Ethiopian eunuch: "What prevents me from being baptized?" Immediately baptized.
- **Acts 16:33** - Philippian jailer: Baptized "at once," middle of the night, after believing.
- **Acts 22:16** - Paul: "Why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins."

No delay. No "pray the sinner's prayer and get baptized later." Baptism is the response of faith, and it's immediate.

## Catholic and Orthodox Positions

**Catholic teaching:**
Baptism is *ordinarily* necessary for salvation. It's the normative means by which God forgives sin and imparts grace.

**Catechism (1257):** "The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation."

**But:** God is not bound to the sacraments. He can save by other means:
- **Baptism of blood** - Martyrs who die for Christ before being baptized
- **Baptism of desire** - Those who would have been baptized if they had known (invincible ignorance)

Still, baptism is not optional. It's the ordinary means. Neglecting it without grave reason is grave sin.

**Orthodox teaching:**
Similar to Catholic but less systematic about exceptions. Baptism is the normative entry into the Church and the Christian life. Outside the Church, no salvation—and baptism brings you into the Church.

## How Proponents Handle Objections

**Objection: The thief on the cross was saved without baptism.**

**Response:** The thief lived and died under the Old Covenant. Jesus hadn't yet died, risen, or commissioned baptism as part of the Gospel. After Pentecost, the New Covenant requirements are in force: repentance, faith, *and* baptism.

Or: Jesus had authority to forgive sins directly (Mark 2:10). He could make exceptions. That doesn't nullify the command for everyone else.

**Objection: Cornelius received the Holy Spirit before baptism (Acts 10:44-47).**

**Response:** The Spirit's coming was a special sign to prove to Peter that Gentiles were included. But Peter still commanded them to be baptized (v.48). Why, if they were already saved? Because baptism is still necessary to complete their conversion and bring them into the church.

**Objection: 1 Corinthians 1:17 - "Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel."**

**Response:** Paul is contrasting his role (apostle/evangelist) with others who baptize. He's not saying baptism isn't part of the Gospel—he's saying his calling was to preach, and others could handle the baptizing.

Also, the Corinthians *were* baptized (v.13-16). Paul didn't do it personally, but it still happened.

**Objection: Ephesians 2:8-9 - "By grace... through faith... not of works."**

**Response:** Baptism isn't a *work* in the sense Paul means (human effort to earn salvation). It's an act of *faith*—obedient trust in God's promise. Just as Abraham was justified by faith when he obeyed God's command to leave his country, so we are justified by faith when we obey God's command to be baptized.

# The "Baptism is Not Necessary" Position

## Evangelical/Baptist Theology

**Core claim:** Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. Baptism is a command to obey *after* salvation, but it's not a condition for receiving salvation.

**Biblical basis:**

**John 3:16** - "Whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life."

One condition: believe. No mention of baptism.

**Acts 16:31** - "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved."

Again: believe = saved. Not believe + be baptized.

**Romans 10:9** - "If you confess with your mouth... and believe in your heart... you will be saved."

Two things: confess and believe. Baptism isn't included.

**Ephesians 2:8-9** - "By grace you have been saved through faith—and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."

If baptism were necessary, salvation would depend on a work (getting baptized). That contradicts "not a result of works."

**Galatians 2:16** - "A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ."

Adding baptism as a requirement makes it a work of law.

**The thief on the cross** (Luke 23:39-43):
He believed, confessed Jesus as Lord, and was promised paradise—without baptism. If Jesus could save him without it, baptism can't be necessary for salvation.

**Cornelius and household** (Acts 10:44-48):
They received the Holy Spirit *before* being baptized. The Spirit indwells believers at conversion (Romans 8:9, Ephesians 1:13). If they had the Spirit, they were already saved. Baptism followed but didn't cause salvation.

**Paul's statement** (1 Corinthians 1:17):
"Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel."

If baptism were part of the Gospel, Paul couldn't say this. He could say, "Christ sent me to preach and baptize." But he separates the two. Preaching the Gospel (which saves) is distinct from baptizing.

**The pattern in Scripture:**

Salvation language is attached to faith, not baptism:
- "Whoever *believes* has eternal life" (John 6:47)
- "To all who *believed* in His name, He gave the right to become children of God" (John 1:12)
- "Everyone who *believes* in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His name" (Acts 10:43)

Baptism is never said to save in its own right. It's always connected to faith (Mark 16:16, Colossians 2:12). The faith saves; the baptism expresses it.

## How Proponents Handle Objections

**Objection: "Baptism now saves you" (1 Peter 3:21).**

**Response:** Read the whole verse: "not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience."

It's not the water that saves. It's the "appeal to God" (or "pledge of a good conscience")—the faith-filled response. Baptism is the act by which we publicly call on God, and *that calling* (faith) is what saves.

**Objection: Acts 2:38 - "Be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins."**

**Response:** The Greek *eis* can mean "because of" or "with reference to." Be baptized *because* your sins are forgiven (see Matthew 12:41 where *eis* means "in response to").

Or: The forgiveness is attached to *repentance*, not baptism. "Repent... for the forgiveness of sins, and be baptized." Repentance brings forgiveness; baptism is the outward response.

**Objection: Mark 16:16 - "Believes and is baptized will be saved."**

**Response:** The second half clarifies: "Whoever does not believe will be condemned." The condemnation is for unbelief, not for lack of baptism. Belief is the hinge.

Also, Mark 16:9-20 isn't in the earliest manuscripts. Many scholars view it as a later addition. Building doctrine on a disputed text is risky.

**Objection: Acts 22:16 - "Wash away your sins."**

**Response:** This is symbolic language. Baptism *pictures* the washing that has already occurred spiritually. Paul was saved on the Damascus road when he encountered Christ. Baptism declared it publicly.

**Objection: Galatians 3:27 - "Baptized into Christ."**

**Response:** Paul uses "baptism" metaphorically throughout his letters. In 1 Corinthians 12:13, "we were all baptized into one body by one Spirit." That's Spirit-baptism (regeneration), not water-baptism. Galatians 3:27 refers to the same reality: being placed *into Christ* by the Spirit's work, symbolized by water baptism.

# The Danger of Each Position

**If baptism is necessary and you teach it's not:**
You're telling people they're saved when they're still lost. You're preaching a false gospel. Millions will stand before God assuming they were saved by faith alone, only to hear, "You never obeyed My command to be baptized."

**If baptism is not necessary and you teach it is:**
You're adding to the Gospel. You're obscuring grace with works. You're binding consciences with a requirement God didn't make. You're creating false assurance (or false despair): "I was baptized, so I'm saved" (even if no faith), or "I haven't been baptized yet, so I'm still lost" (even though I believe).

# The Hebrew Context: Baptism and Conversion

In [Jewish practice](#baptism/mikveh 'Hebrew'), Gentile converts underwent:
1. Circumcision (males)
2. Mikveh (ritual immersion)
3. Offering a sacrifice (while the temple stood)

The *mikveh* marked the transition: you go down a Gentile, you come up a Jew. It was initiation, not optional.

John's baptism adapted this: you go down in your sins, you come up cleansed (repentance baptism). Jesus adapts it further: you go down in Adam, you come up in Christ.

Does this make baptism necessary? It certainly makes it normative. The New Testament never envisions unbaptized Christians. The question is whether the norm is a *requirement* or a *pattern*.

# Can Both Be Right?

**Some attempt middle ground:**
- Baptism is *normally* when God saves, but He can save without it (extraordinary cases)
- Refusing baptism after hearing the Gospel indicates lack of genuine faith (so unbaptized "believers" may not be truly saved anyway)
- Baptism is necessary *in the same sense* that confessing Christ is necessary (Romans 10:9)—not as a work that earns salvation, but as the God-appointed way of receiving and declaring it

**Others see no compromise:**
- Either it's necessary or it's not
- Either you can be saved without it or you can't
- Either the thief on the cross is the exception or the rule

The division is sharp. Churches of Christ won't fellowship those who teach faith-only. Baptists won't accept Churches of Christ as preaching the true Gospel.

At stake: What is the Gospel? Is it "Believe and be baptized" or "Believe, then show your faith by being baptized"? The difference is not semantic—it's eternal.
