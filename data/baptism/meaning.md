[Baptism](#baptism/baptism 'Parent')
---
What does baptism *do*? Is it a *sacrament* that conveys grace, or an *ordinance* that symbolizes faith?

**The Sacramental View:**
- Baptism is a [means of grace](#baptism/sacrament 'Greek')—God acts through it to save, regenerate, unite to Christ
- "Baptism now saves you" (1 Peter 3:21)
- "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God" (John 3:5)
- The sign *effects* what it signifies (Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran view)

**The Symbolic View:**
- Baptism is an *outward sign* of an *inward reality* already present
- "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved" - belief comes first (Mark 16:16)
- The thief on the cross was saved without baptism (Luke 23:43)
- The sign *declares* what God has done, it doesn't *cause* it (Baptist, Reformed view)

The tension: Does water *do* something, or does it *show* something?

# The Sacramental Position

## Catholic and Orthodox Teaching

**Baptism:**
- Removes original sin
- Imparts sanctifying grace
- Unites the baptized to Christ
- Makes the person a member of the Church
- Leaves an indelible spiritual mark

The Catholic Catechism (1263): "By Baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins, as well as all punishment for sin."

This is *ex opere operato*—"from the work worked." The sacrament is effective not because of the recipient's faith or the minister's worthiness, but because Christ instituted it and works through it.

**Biblical basis:**
- **John 3:5** - "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." Water baptism is the new birth.
- **Acts 2:38** - "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins." Baptism *for* forgiveness—it brings about what it signifies.
- **Acts 22:16** - "Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name." Sins are washed away *in* baptism.
- **Titus 3:5** - "He saved us... by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit." The washing (baptism) is instrumental in salvation.
- **1 Peter 3:21** - "Baptism... now saves you." Not just symbolizes salvation—*saves*.

**How it works:**
God has chosen to work through physical means. Just as Christ took on flesh (Incarnation), just as bread and wine become His body and blood (Eucharist), so water becomes the instrument of regeneration in baptism.

This is not magic. It's *sacrament*—God binding His promise to a visible sign, so we can trust not in feelings or experience but in what He has objectively done.

## Lutheran Theology

Lutherans affirm baptismal regeneration but with nuance:

**"Baptism is not just plain water, but it is water included in God's command and combined with God's Word."** (Small Catechism)

The water doesn't save by its own power. God's Word attached to the water makes it effective.

**Key texts:**
- **Romans 6:3-4** - "We were buried with Him by baptism into death... raised... to walk in newness of life." Baptism unites us to Christ's death and resurrection.
- **Galatians 3:27** - "As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ." Baptism clothes us with Christ Himself.
- **Colossians 2:12** - "Buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith." Baptism and faith work together.

**Lutheran emphasis:** Baptism is God's work, not ours. We don't baptize ourselves to show our faith—God baptizes us to create and sustain faith. It's pure grace, the Gospel in water form.

## Reformed (Calvinist) View: Covenant Sign

Reformed theology holds a middle position:

**Baptism is a sign and seal of the covenant**—like circumcision in the Old Testament. It doesn't automatically regenerate, but it visibly marks covenant membership and seals God's promises.

**What it signifies:**
- Cleansing from sin (1 Corinthians 6:11)
- Union with Christ (Galatians 3:27)
- Adoption into God's family (Galatians 3:26-27)

**What it doesn't do:**
- It doesn't guarantee salvation apart from faith
- It doesn't automatically regenerate (the Holy Spirit regenerates when and how He wills)
- Many baptized people (especially in [infant baptism](#baptism/subjects#paedobaptist-position 'Greek') traditions) grow up and reject the faith—were they ever truly saved? No.

**The distinction:**
- **Visible church:** Those who are baptized and profess faith
- **Invisible church:** Those who are truly regenerate

Baptism brings you into the visible church, but only the Spirit's work makes you part of the invisible church.

**Westminster Confession (28.6):**
"The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered... the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God's own will, in His appointed time."

In other words: The sign is given, but the reality may come later (or not at all, if the person never believes).

# The Symbolic Position

## Baptist and Evangelical View

**Baptism is an ordinance, not a sacrament:**
- It's a command to obey (Matthew 28:19)
- It's a public profession of faith already present
- It's a symbol of what has already happened spiritually

**The order:**
1. Hear the Gospel
2. Believe and be saved
3. Be baptized as testimony to that salvation

Baptism doesn't save. Faith saves. Baptism declares that salvation publicly.

**Biblical basis:**
- **Mark 16:16** - "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned." Belief is the hinge; unbelief condemns, but lack of baptism doesn't.
- **Luke 23:43** - The thief on the cross: "Today you will be with Me in Paradise." Saved without baptism.
- **Acts 10:47-48** - Cornelius and household receive the Holy Spirit *before* being baptized. The spiritual reality precedes the physical sign.
- **Romans 10:9** - "If you confess with your mouth... and believe in your heart... you will be saved." No mention of baptism as requirement.
- **Ephesians 2:8-9** - "By grace you have been saved through faith... not a result of works." Baptism is a work; it can't save.

**The thief on the cross argument:**
If baptism were necessary for salvation, the thief died lost. But Jesus promised him paradise. Therefore baptism cannot be a requirement.

Sacramentalists respond: The thief lived under the Old Covenant, before Jesus instituted Christian baptism. After Pentecost, baptism becomes the normative means of entering the New Covenant community.

**Romans 6 reinterpreted:**
"Buried with Him by baptism into death" (Romans 6:4) is about *identification*, not causation. Just as a wedding ring symbolizes marriage without creating it, baptism symbolizes union with Christ without effecting it.

The spiritual reality is "baptism into Christ" by the Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13). Water baptism *pictures* that spiritual baptism.

## The Danger of Sacramentalism

**Symbolic-view advocates warn:**
If baptism saves, then:
- Salvation depends on finding water and a minister, not just on faith in Christ
- The ground of assurance shifts from Christ's finished work to a ritual I underwent
- False security: "I was baptized as a baby, so I'm saved"—even if living in unbelief

This obscures the Gospel. Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ alone, not by water.

**Sacramentalists respond:**
The symbolic view empties baptism of meaning. If it's "just a symbol," why does Scripture use such strong language—"baptism now saves you," "wash away your sins," "born of water"?

God uses physical means. Jesus spit and made mud to heal a blind man (John 9:6). The brass serpent healed those who looked at it (Numbers 21:9). Naaman was cleansed by dipping in the Jordan (2 Kings 5:14).

Why is it so hard to believe God uses water to convey grace?

# Key Texts in Dispute

## 1 Peter 3:21

"Baptism, which corresponds to this [the flood], now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

**Sacramental reading:**
"Baptism now saves you"—plain as day. The flood saved Noah and his family (they passed through water to safety), and baptism saves us in corresponding fashion.

The parenthetical clarifies: It's not the physical washing that saves, but the spiritual reality the water conveys—cleansing of conscience through Christ's resurrection.

**Symbolic reading:**
The key phrase is "an appeal to God for a good conscience" (some translations: "the pledge of a good conscience"). Baptism is our appeal/pledge—our response of faith. The faith saves; the baptism expresses it.

Peter isn't saying water regenerates. He's saying baptism is the outward act by which we call on God, and *that faith-filled calling* is what saves (see Romans 10:13).

## Acts 2:38

"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

**Sacramental reading:**
Repent and be baptized *for* forgiveness. The Greek *eis* (εἰς) indicates purpose or result: baptism is *in order to obtain* forgiveness.

Parallel structure: "repent... for forgiveness" and "be baptized... for forgiveness." Both are instrumental.

**Symbolic reading:**
The Greek *eis* can also mean "because of" or "with reference to." Be baptized *because* your sins are forgiven (see Matthew 12:41 where *eis* means "in response to").

Alternatively: "Repent... for the forgiveness of sins, and be baptized." Repentance brings forgiveness; baptism is the public response.

The Holy Spirit is *received* at conversion (Galatians 3:2, Ephesians 1:13), not at water baptism.

## John 3:5

"Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."

**Sacramental reading:**
"Water and Spirit" = water baptism accompanied by the Spirit's work. Two elements of one new birth.

Church Fathers (Justin Martyr, Irenaeus) read it this way. Baptism is the regenerative washing, the Spirit is the power behind it.

**Symbolic reading:**
"Water and Spirit" = two metaphors for the same thing (Spirit's cleansing), or "water" = natural birth, "Spirit" = spiritual birth ("born of flesh" in v.6).

Or: "Water" = the Word of God (Ephesians 5:26—"washing of water with the word"). Regeneration comes through the Spirit applying the Word, not through ritual.

Jesus is talking to Nicodemus about spiritual realities, not instituting a sacrament.

# The Hebrew Lens: Mikveh and Repentance

Jewish ritual immersion (*mikveh*) provides context:
- Full-body immersion for purification
- Converts to Judaism underwent *mikveh* as part of initiation (along with circumcision for males)
- Symbolized leaving old identity, entering new

John's baptism built on this but added moral urgency: "Bear fruits in keeping with repentance" (Matthew 3:8). Not ritual purity, but heart transformation.

When Jesus commands baptism (Matthew 28:19), He's drawing on this [Hebrew tradition](#baptism/mikveh 'Hebrew'): public identification with God's people, cleansing, new beginning.

Does that make it merely symbolic? Or does God work through the act to accomplish what it signifies?

# Can Both Be Right?

**Some attempt synthesis:**
- Baptism is *normally* the means by which God saves (Acts 2:38), but God is not bound to it (the thief on the cross)
- The sign and the reality are meant to coincide—baptism *should* accompany faith, and God works through it—but the two can be separated
- Trusting in baptism apart from faith is empty (sacramentalism as magic); dismissing baptism as irrelevant contradicts Scripture's strong language

**Others see no middle ground:**
- Either water saves or it doesn't
- Either baptism is necessary or it isn't
- Either it's a sacrament or a symbol

The division remains. Catholics won't commune Baptists; Baptists re-baptize converts from Catholicism (viewing infant baptism as invalid). The meaning of baptism is not a secondary issue—it shapes how we understand salvation itself.
