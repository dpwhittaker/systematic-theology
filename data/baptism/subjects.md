[Baptism](#baptism/baptism 'Parent')

Who should be baptized? *Believers only* (credobaptism) or *infants of believers* (paedobaptism)?

This divides Protestant Christianity more sharply than almost any other issue.

**The Believer's Baptism Argument:**
- New Testament pattern: repentance, faith, *then* baptism (Acts 2:38, 8:12, 16:31-33)
- No explicit infant baptism in Scripture
- Baptism is a conscious response to the Gospel, impossible for infants
- "He who believes and is baptized will be saved" (Mark 16:16) - faith precedes baptism

**The Infant Baptism Argument:**
- [Covenant theology](#baptism/infant 'Greek'): Baptism replaces circumcision (Colossians 2:11-12)
- Household baptisms (Acts 16:15, 16:33, 1 Corinthians 1:16) likely included infants
- Children of believers are "holy" (1 Corinthians 7:14) - set apart, in covenant community
- Jesus blessed children, saying "to such belongs the kingdom" (Mark 10:14)

The division: Baptists, Pentecostals, most non-denominational churches reject infant baptism. Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, Reformed, Anglicans practice it.

# The New Testament Pattern

What does the Bible actually show?

## The Believer's Baptism Case

**Every explicit baptism in Acts follows this pattern:**
1. Gospel preached
2. Hearers believe
3. Believers baptized

Examples:
- **Pentecost** (Acts 2:37-41): "Repent and be baptized... those who received his word were baptized"
- **Samaria** (Acts 8:12): "When they believed Philip... they were baptized, both men and women"
- **Ethiopian eunuch** (Acts 8:36-38): Philip preaches Jesus, eunuch says "I believe," then is baptized
- **Paul** (Acts 9:18): After encountering Christ, Paul believes and is baptized
- **Cornelius** (Acts 10:47-48): Receives Holy Spirit, then baptized
- **Lydia** (Acts 16:14-15): "The Lord opened her heart," then she was baptized
- **Philippian jailer** (Acts 16:31-33): "Believe... and you will be saved," then baptized
- **Corinthians** (Acts 18:8): "Many... believed and were baptized"

The sequence is consistent: hear, believe, be baptized. No examples of baptism preceding or replacing faith.

**Jesus' command:**
Matthew 28:19 - "Make disciples... baptizing them."

Credobaptists argue: You make someone a disciple, *then* baptize them. The baptism follows and signifies the discipleship, it doesn't create it.

Mark 16:16 - "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved."

The order: believe, be baptized, saved. Faith comes first.

**Theological argument:**
Baptism is an act of obedience, a public profession of faith. Infants cannot believe, repent, or profess faith. Baptizing them is meaningless at best, presumptuous at worst.

Romans 6:3-4 connects baptism to *identification* with Christ in His death and resurrection. This is conscious, deliberate union—not automatic because of family membership.

## The Infant Baptism Case

**Covenant theology:**
God deals with families, not just individuals. The Abrahamic covenant included children: "I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your offspring after you" (Genesis 17:7).

Circumcision was given to eight-day-old boys (Genesis 17:12). They didn't choose it, couldn't understand it, didn't consent. Yet it marked them as covenant members.

Colossians 2:11-12 - "In Him you were circumcised... having been buried with Him in baptism."

If baptism is the New Covenant equivalent of circumcision, and circumcision was given to infants, why wouldn't baptism be?

**Household baptisms:**
- Acts 16:15 - Lydia "and her household" were baptized
- Acts 16:33 - The jailer "and all his family" were baptized
- 1 Corinthians 1:16 - Paul baptized "the household of Stephanas"

Paedobaptists argue: Ancient households included infants and small children. When the head of household converted, the whole family was brought into the covenant community through baptism.

**Children in the covenant:**
1 Corinthians 7:14 - "The unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy."

Paul calls children of believers "holy"—set apart, in some sense already belonging to God. If they're covenant members, shouldn't they receive the covenant sign?

**Jesus and children:**
Mark 10:13-16 - Jesus rebukes disciples for keeping children away: "Let the little children come to Me... for to such belongs the kingdom of God."

He doesn't say "wait until they can believe." He blesses them, declares the kingdom theirs. Paedobaptists see this as warrant for including children in the visible church through baptism.

## Historical Practice

**Early Church:**

The New Testament doesn't explicitly describe infant baptism. But by the 2nd-3rd century, the church was practicing it:

- **Irenaeus** (late 2nd century): "He came to save all through means of Himself—all, I say, who through Him are born again to God—infants, and children, and boys, and youths, and old men."

- **Origen** (early 3rd century): "The Church received from the apostles the tradition of giving baptism even to infants."

- **Cyprian** (3rd century): Argued infants should be baptized as soon as possible, even before the eighth day.

**The question:** Did the apostles practice infant baptism but not record it? Or did the church innovate in the 2nd century?

Paedobaptists: The silence in Scripture is because it was assumed. Of course covenant children receive the covenant sign—just as in the Old Testament.

Credobaptists: The silence is because it didn't happen. The New Testament's consistent pattern is faith-then-baptism. The 2nd-century development was a departure.

## Theological Implications

**For Credobaptists:**
Infant baptism undermines the Gospel by suggesting:
- Salvation comes through family lineage, not personal faith
- Covenant membership is inherited, not chosen
- The sign precedes the reality (baptized before believing)

It also creates confusion: Do baptized infants need to "get saved" later? Were they already Christians? What if they grow up and reject the faith—were they ever truly baptized?

Believer's baptism maintains clarity: You believe, you're saved, you publicly declare it through baptism.

**For Paedobaptists:**
Believer's baptism undermines the covenant by suggesting:
- God deals with atomized individuals, not families
- Children are *outside* the covenant until they choose to enter
- Baptism is a human work (our testimony) rather than God's promise

It also fosters presumption: "I chose Jesus, I decided to follow Him"—as if salvation starts with human will rather than God's grace.

Infant baptism maintains humility: God claimed you before you could claim Him. You were loved, chosen, marked as His—not because you earned it, but because He is gracious.

## Can Both Be Valid?

Some seek common ground:
- Paedobaptists don't claim baptism *saves* infants (most don't)—it marks them as part of the covenant community, but they must later embrace faith personally
- Credobaptists acknowledge children in Christian homes are blessed, under the influence of the Gospel, even if not baptized as infants

Yet the division remains sharp. Credobaptists often view paedobaptism as theological error; paedobaptists often view credobaptism as breaking covenant with the children God has given.

Churches split over this. Families agonize over it. Some practice "dual membership" (allowing both views in one congregation). Others demand uniformity.

Is one right and the other wrong? Or does the debate itself reveal deeper tensions between [Hebrew](#baptism/mikveh 'Hebrew') and [Greek](#baptism/infant 'Greek') ways of thinking?
