[Baptism](#baptism/baptism 'Parent')

Who should be baptized? *Believers only* (credobaptism) or *infants of believers* (paedobaptism)?

This divides Protestant Christianity more sharply than almost any other issue.

**The Believer's Baptism Argument:**
- New Testament pattern: repentance, faith, *then* baptism (Acts 2:38, 8:12, 16:31-33)
- No explicit infant baptism in Scripture
- Baptism is a conscious response to the Gospel, impossible for infants
- "He who believes and is baptized will be saved" (Mark 16:16) - faith precedes baptism

**The Infant Baptism Argument:**
- [Covenant theology](#covenant-theology): Baptism replaces circumcision (Colossians 2:11-12)
- [Household baptisms](#household-baptisms) (Acts 16:15, 16:33, 1 Corinthians 1:16) likely included infants
- Children of believers are "holy" (1 Corinthians 7:14) - set apart, in covenant community
- Jesus blessed children, saying "to such belongs the kingdom" (Mark 10:14)

The division: Baptists, Pentecostals, most non-denominational churches reject infant baptism. Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, Reformed, Anglicans practice it.

# The New Testament Pattern

What does the Bible actually show?

## The Believer's Baptism Case {#credobaptist-position}

**Every explicit baptism in Acts follows this pattern:**
1. Gospel preached
2. Hearers believe
3. Believers baptized

Examples:
- **Pentecost** (Acts 2:37-41): "Repent and be baptized... those who received his word were baptized"
- **Samaria** (Acts 8:12): "When they believed Philip... they were baptized, both men and women"
- **Ethiopian eunuch** (Acts 8:36-38): Philip preaches Jesus, eunuch says "I believe," then is baptized
- **Paul** (Acts 9:18): After encountering Christ, Paul believes and is baptized
- **Cornelius** (Acts 10:47-48): Receives Holy Spirit, then baptized
- **Lydia** (Acts 16:14-15): "The Lord opened her heart," then she was baptized
- **Philippian jailer** (Acts 16:31-33): "Believe... and you will be saved," then baptized
- **Corinthians** (Acts 18:8): "Many... believed and were baptized"

The sequence is consistent: hear, believe, be baptized. No examples of baptism preceding or replacing faith.

**Jesus' command:**
Matthew 28:19 - "Make disciples... baptizing them."

Credobaptists argue: You make someone a disciple, *then* baptize them. The baptism follows and signifies the discipleship, it doesn't create it.

Mark 16:16 - "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved."

The order: believe, be baptized, saved. Faith comes first.

**Theological argument:**
Baptism is an act of obedience, a public profession of faith. Infants cannot believe, repent, or profess faith. Baptizing them is meaningless at best, presumptuous at worst.

Romans 6:3-4 connects baptism to *identification* with Christ in His death and resurrection. This is conscious, deliberate union—not automatic because of family membership.

# The Covenant Theology Foundation {#covenant-theology}

## God's Pattern: Families, Not Just Individuals {#paedobaptist-position}

**Genesis 17:7** - "I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you."

God doesn't just make covenant with Abraham—He includes Abraham's children. The covenant is *generational*, not atomistic.

**The Abrahamic covenant:**
- Promise to Abraham
- Extends to Isaac, Jacob, and all descendants
- Children are *born into* the covenant, not left outside until they choose to enter

**The sign: Circumcision (Genesis 17:10-14)**
- Given to Abraham and all males in his household
- Given to 8-day-old boys—infants who can't understand, choose, or consent
- "Every male throughout your generations" (v.12)

Paedobaptists argue: If God included children in the Old Covenant and gave them the covenant sign (circumcision) before they could believe, why would He exclude them in the New Covenant?

## Baptism as the New Covenant Sign

**Colossians 2:11-12** - "In Him you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised Him from the dead."

Paedobaptists see this as the key text: *Baptism replaces circumcision.*

**The parallel:**
| Old Covenant | New Covenant |
|--------------|--------------|
| Circumcision | Baptism |
| Sign of covenant membership | Sign of covenant membership |
| Given to infants | Given to infants (paedobaptist view) |
| Marks you as God's people | Marks you as God's people |

**The logic:**
If baptism is the New Covenant equivalent of circumcision, and circumcision was given to infants, then baptism should be given to infants.

To withhold baptism from children of believers is to treat them as *outside* the covenant—worse off than Old Covenant children, who received the sign.

## Children in the Covenant

**1 Corinthians 7:14** - "The unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy."

Paul calls children of at least one believing parent "*holy*"—set apart, belonging to God in some sense.

Paedobaptists argue: If they're holy (covenant members), shouldn't they receive the covenant sign?

**Acts 2:38-39** - "Repent and be baptized... For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to Himself."

"For you *and for your children*"—echoing the Abrahamic covenant language. The promise extends to the next generation.

Paedobaptists: The Gospel doesn't *narrow* God's covenant to exclude children. It *expands* it to include Gentiles ("all who are far off"). Children remain included, as they always were.

## Household Baptisms {#household-baptisms}

The New Testament records several "household" baptisms:
- **Acts 16:15** - Lydia "and her household" were baptized
- **Acts 16:33** - Philippian jailer "and all his family" were baptized
- **1 Corinthians 1:16** - "The household of Stephanas"

**Paedobaptist argument:**
Ancient households included infants and small children. When the head of the household believed and was baptized, the whole family was brought into the covenant community—including children.

**Credobaptist response:**
The text doesn't say there were infants. "Household" could mean adult family members, servants, extended family—all of whom believed. Acts 16:34 says the jailer "rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God"—implying the household also believed.

## Jesus and Children

**Mark 10:13-16** - "People were bringing little children to Him that He might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it, He was indignant and said to them, 'Let the children come to Me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.' And He took them in His arms and blessed them, laying His hands on them."

**Paedobaptist reading:**
Jesus welcomes children, declares the kingdom theirs, blesses them. He doesn't say "Wait until they can believe." He rebukes those who would keep children away.

If Jesus welcomes them, shouldn't the church? And if they belong to the kingdom, shouldn't they receive the kingdom's sign (baptism)?

**Credobaptist reading:**
Jesus blesses them, but He doesn't baptize them. He's teaching about childlike faith ("receive the kingdom *like a child*"), not about infant baptism.

The kingdom belongs to "such as these"—those with childlike trust. That's a character trait, not an age category.

# How Infant Baptism Works: Different Traditions

## Catholic and Orthodox: Sacramental Regeneration

**Roman Catholic teaching:**
Baptism removes original sin, imparts sanctifying grace, and makes the infant a Christian.

**Catechism (1250):** "Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the children of God."

The infant is regenerated *in baptism*. Before baptism: under Adam, in original sin. After baptism: in Christ, cleansed, a member of the Church.

**But what about faith?**

Faith will be nurtured as the child grows. The parents and godparents promise to raise the child in the faith. Baptism plants the seed; upbringing cultivates it.

**What if the child later rejects the faith?**

They have been baptized (the mark is indelible), but they need to repent and return to active faith. Baptism doesn't guarantee final salvation—it initiates the process, which must be completed by ongoing faith and obedience.

## Lutheran: Baptism Creates Faith

Lutherans also affirm baptismal regeneration but emphasize that baptism creates faith in the infant.

**How can an infant have faith?**

God can work faith in anyone, including infants. Jesus said children can believe (Matthew 18:6—"these little ones who believe in Me"). If God can give faith to adults through hearing the Word (Romans 10:17), He can give faith to infants through the Word attached to water (baptism).

**Small Catechism:** "Baptism works forgiveness of sins, rescues from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe."

The infant believes (by God's gift) and is saved in baptism.

**Later apostasy?**

The child may later fall away from faith (losing what was given in baptism). Baptism gives faith; ongoing nurture sustains it. If the child rejects Christ, the baptismal grace is forfeited.

## Reformed: Covenant Sign, Not Automatic Regeneration

**Reformed theology (Calvin, Westminster Confession):**
Baptism is the *sign* of the covenant, but it doesn't automatically regenerate.

**What baptism does for infants:**
- Marks them as members of the visible church
- Seals God's covenant promises to them
- Obligates parents to raise them in the faith
- Anticipates future faith (which may come in childhood, youth, or adulthood)

**The distinction:**
- **Visible church:** Those who are baptized and profess faith (or whose parents do)
- **Invisible church:** Those who are truly regenerate (known only to God)

Baptism brings the infant into the visible church. But only the Holy Spirit's work makes them part of the invisible church. That may happen in baptism, or years later, or never (if they apostatize).

**Westminster Confession (28.6):**
"The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is administered... the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God's own will, in His appointed time."

Translation: God may regenerate the infant at baptism, or later. The sign is given; the reality comes in God's timing.

# Objections to Infant Baptism {#objections-infant}

## No Command or Example

**Credobaptist argument:**
The New Testament never commands infant baptism. Every example of baptism is of believers—people who heard the Gospel, believed, then were baptized.

**Paedobaptist response:**
The New Testament also never *forbids* infant baptism. And the household baptisms likely included infants.

More importantly: The New Testament assumes continuity with the Old Covenant. Children were included in the Old Covenant (circumcision); why would they be excluded in the New?

The silence isn't because infant baptism was rejected—it's because it was *assumed*.

## Baptism Requires Faith

**Credobaptist argument:**
"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved" (Mark 16:16). Faith comes first. Infants can't believe, so they can't be baptized.

**Paedobaptist response:**
Faith is required *eventually*, not necessarily *before* baptism. The child receives the sign, then is raised to understand and embrace the reality the sign represents.

Parallel: Circumcision was given to infants, but later they were expected to "circumcise their hearts" (Deuteronomy 10:16)—inward faith corresponding to the outward sign.

Also: Jesus said children can believe (Matthew 18:6). God can work faith in infants, even if we can't perceive it.

## Creates False Security

**Credobaptist argument:**
Infant baptism fosters presumption: "I was baptized as a baby, so I'm a Christian"—even if the person shows no evidence of faith.

It also creates confusion: If you were baptized as an infant, do you need to "get saved" later? Were you already a Christian? How do you know?

**Paedobaptist response:**
Baptism is the *beginning*, not the end. Just as circumcision didn't guarantee salvation (Romans 2:25-29), baptism doesn't either. The child must grow up and embrace the faith.

Baptizing infants actually *prevents* presumption: it shows that salvation is *God's work*, not ours. We don't choose God; He chooses us (even before we can choose).

## Different from the Old Covenant

**Credobaptist argument:**
The New Covenant is *not like* the Old Covenant. Jeremiah 31:31-34 describes a new covenant where "all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest." Everyone in the New Covenant knows God personally.

The Old Covenant included unbelievers (ethnic Israel, circumcised but not regenerate). The New Covenant is only true believers. Therefore, baptism (New Covenant sign) should only go to believers, not all children.

**Paedobaptist response:**
The New Covenant is superior because it accomplishes what the Old pointed to (internal transformation, hearts of flesh, forgiveness). But it's still a *covenant*—and covenants include families.

The promise "they shall all know Me" is fulfilled *ultimately* in glory. In this age, the visible church (like Israel) includes both true believers and those who are covenant members but not regenerate. Baptism marks visible membership; regeneration is God's hidden work.

# Objections to Believer's Baptism {#objections-believer}

## Undermines the Covenant

**Paedobaptist argument:**
Believer's baptism treats children as *outside* the covenant until they choose to enter. This contradicts God's pattern of dealing with families generationally.

It also implies salvation begins with human decision ("I chose Jesus") rather than God's sovereign grace ("He chose me before I could choose Him").

**Credobaptist response:**
The New Covenant is entered by faith, not birth. God's grace precedes our faith, but baptism is the public profession of that faith—not a sign given before faith exists.

Children in Christian homes are blessed, nurtured, taught, prayed for—but baptism waits for their own profession of faith.

## Fosters Presumption

**Paedobaptist argument:**
Believer's baptism can create pride: "I made the decision, I chose to be baptized, I publicly declared my faith"—as if salvation is a human achievement.

**Credobaptist response:**
Baptism doesn't create faith; it expresses faith. The decision to follow Christ is itself a gift of grace (Ephesians 2:8-9). Believer's baptism acknowledges: "God saved me, and I respond in obedience."

## Ignores Historical Practice

**Paedobaptist argument:**
By the 2nd-3rd century, the church was practicing infant baptism universally. Irenaeus, Origen, Cyprian all affirm it. Did the entire church apostatize? Or did the apostles practice infant baptism without explicitly recording it?

**Credobaptist response:**
The New Testament is silent on infant baptism because it didn't happen. The 2nd-century development was a departure from apostolic practice, influenced by:
- Belief in baptismal regeneration (baptism saves)
- High infant mortality (parents feared unbaptized babies would be lost)
- Cultural pressure to conform to Jewish/Roman household religion patterns

The Reformation recovered the biblical pattern: faith, then baptism.

# Historical Practice

**Early Church:**

The New Testament doesn't explicitly describe infant baptism. But by the 2nd-3rd century, the church was practicing it:

- **Irenaeus** (late 2nd century): "He came to save all through means of Himself—all, I say, who through Him are born again to God—infants, and children, and boys, and youths, and old men."

- **Origen** (early 3rd century): "The Church received from the apostles the tradition of giving baptism even to infants."

- **Cyprian** (3rd century): Argued infants should be baptized as soon as possible, even before the eighth day.

**The question:** Did the apostles practice infant baptism but not record it? Or did the church innovate in the 2nd century?

Paedobaptists: The silence in Scripture is because it was assumed. Of course covenant children receive the covenant sign—just as in the Old Testament.

Credobaptists: The silence is because it didn't happen. The New Testament's consistent pattern is faith-then-baptism. The 2nd-century development was a departure.

# The Pastoral Question

## For Parents

If you believe in infant baptism:
- You baptize your baby as soon as possible (usually within weeks or months of birth)
- You're confident your child is in the covenant, marked as God's own
- You raise them in the faith, teaching them that baptism is *their* baptism (not waiting for them to "get baptized" later)

If you believe in believer's baptism:
- You dedicate your baby to God (publicly committing to raise them in the faith)
- You teach them the Gospel and pray for their conversion
- When they profess faith, you baptize them (often in childhood or adolescence)

**The anguish:**
Mixed marriages (one spouse paedobaptist, the other credobaptist) face painful decisions. Do we baptize the baby or not? Whose conviction wins?

Some compromise: "We'll dedicate now, and if the child wants to be baptized later, we will." But that satisfies neither side fully.

## For Churches

**Paedobaptist churches:**
- Baptize infants of members
- Expect baptized children to later "confirm" their faith (Confirmation in Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican traditions)
- Discipline members who don't raise baptized children in the faith

**Credobaptist churches:**
- Refuse to baptize infants
- Offer child dedication instead
- View paedobaptism as invalid (many rebaptize converts from paedobaptist churches)

**The division:**
Some paedobaptist churches won't accept credobaptists as members (unless they're willing to baptize their children). Some credobaptist churches won't accept paedobaptists as truly baptized (demanding rebaptism).

# Can Both Be Valid?

**Some attempt mutual recognition:**
- "We disagree on the subjects of baptism, but both are valid Christian practices."
- Both sides love Jesus, trust His Word, seek to obey—we just interpret the commands differently.
- Unity in Christ is more important than uniformity on baptism.

**Others see no compromise:**
- Either God commands infant baptism (in which case withholding it is disobedience) or He forbids it (in which case practicing it is presumption)
- Either baptism is for believers only (in which case paedobaptism is meaningless) or for covenant children (in which case credobaptism treats children as pagans)
- This isn't a secondary issue—it shapes how we understand the church, salvation, and covenant

The debate has raged for 500 years (since the Reformation). It shows no sign of resolution.

Does God work through families and visible community (Hebrew emphasis), or through individual decision and personal faith (Greek emphasis)? Perhaps the answer is *both*—but how they relate remains contested.
