title: Baptism
---
[Church](#church/church 'Parent')
---
Water and Spirit. Identity and initiation. One of the most *divided* practices in Christianity.

The debates:
- [Mode](#baptism/mode 'Drill') - Immersion, sprinkling, or pouring?
- [Subjects](#baptism/subjects 'Drill') - Infants or believers only?
- [Sacrament](#baptism/sacrament 'Drill') - Does baptism convey grace or symbolize faith?
- [Necessity](#baptism/necessity 'Drill') - Required for salvation?
- [Spirit baptism](#baptism/spirit 'Drill') - One event or two?

The [Hebrew lens](#baptism/mikveh 'Hebrew'): Ritual immersion (*mikveh*), repentance, public identification with God's people.
The [Greek lens](#baptism/sacrament 'Greek'): Sacramental theology, means of grace, covenant sign parallel to circumcision.

These are not minor disagreements. Denominations split over this. Churches refuse fellowship over it. Families divide when one baptizes infants and another demands believer's baptism.

Can both be right? Must one be wrong? Or does the tension itself reveal something?
