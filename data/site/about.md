# About This Systematic Theology Project

## Purpose

This site explores a central tension in Christian theology: **Does Greek philosophical categorization distort Hebrew biblical revelation?**

Traditional [Systematic Theology](#TOC 'Drill') organizes doctrine into categories—God, Christ, salvation, church. This assumes truth can be systematized. But if the organizational method itself comes from Greek philosophy, does it reshape the content?

## Core Thesis

**The Hebrew-Greek Tension:**

**Greek thinking** (Hellenistic):
- Favors abstraction, definition, universal propositions
- Seeks timeless truths through categorical organization
- Values logical consistency, systematic coherence, resolution of paradoxes

**Hebrew thinking** (biblical):
- Favors narrative, relationship, concrete particularity
- Reveals truth through covenant history and personal encounter
- Embraces paradox, wrestling, and irreducible mystery

The site doesn't advocate for one over the other. It explores what each reveals and what each obscures, asking: *Can Christian theology, inheriting both traditions, hold them together?*

## Target Audience

Conservative Americans raised in churches that emphasize Greek systematic categories. The site deliberately gives more weight to Hebrew perspectives—not because they're superior, but to **counterbalance** an existing imbalance in theological formation.

This is pedagogical strategy, not bias. The goal: equip readers to see with both eyes.

## Methodology

### The Lattice Structure

Content uses a **lattice (Directed Acyclic Graph)** rather than rigid tree hierarchy:
- Each theological concept can have multiple parents and multiple children
- Example: "Blood" connects to God, Christ, Salvation, and Church simultaneously
- This resists the rigid categorization being critiqued

### Color-Coded Navigation

Links are categorized by column type, each with theological significance:
- **Yellow (Hebrew):** Concrete, narrative, relational concepts
- **Cyan (Greek):** Abstract, categorical, systematic concepts
- **Green (Drill):** Detailed exploration and evidence
- **Purple (Parent):** Navigation up the hierarchy

Keyboard navigation matches physical directions:
- **LEFT:** Cycle through Hebrew links
- **RIGHT:** Cycle through Greek links
- **DOWN:** Cycle through Drill links
- **UP:** Cycle through Parent links and history

### HUD Design Constraints

The site is optimized for smart glasses (Heads-Up Display):
- **Zero scrolling:** All content fits in viewport
- **High contrast:** Black background, bright colors for transparent displays
- **Keyboard-first navigation:** Works with simple D-pad controls
- **Glanceable:** Top-level content readable in < 2 seconds

## Documentation

### Icon Design
[Icon Design](#site/ICONS 'Drill') - Explore the symbolism behind the favicon and app icons. The split design (Hebrew Aleph-Tav in yellow, Greek Alpha-Omega in cyan) visually represents the duality between Hebrew and Greek frameworks.

### Theological Balance Analysis
[Potential Biases](#site/PotentialBiases 'Drill') - A comprehensive analysis of theological balance across all 91 markdown files. Identifies areas where conservative positions need strengthening, missing viewpoints, and language requiring adjustment. Essential reading for understanding the site's approach to fairness.

### Spirit Christology Research
[Spirit Christology: Biblical Data](#site/SpiritChristology 'Drill') - Exhaustive catalog of every biblical text regarding Jesus's deity, humanity, and relationships with the Father and Holy Spirit. Presents the full evidence for both Logos Christology (traditional) and Spirit Christology (alternative) without cherry-picking verses. Includes critical observations about Jesus's baptism and the Spirit's descent.

### Additional Resources

## Core Beliefs (Not Biases)

These foundational commitments guide all content:

1. **Scripture's Authority:**
   The usefulness of Scripture for encountering God is non-negotiable. Even when questioning terms like "inerrancy" and "infallibility," the site affirms Scripture as God's authoritative revelation.

2. **Original Meaning Principle:**
   "It can never mean to you what it never could have meant to the original reader/hearer." Meaning is anchored in authorial intent and historical context, though application varies.

3. **Both/And Over Either/Or:**
   The Hebrew concept of *eilu v'eilu* ("these and these are words of the living God") runs throughout. Opposing positions often both protect essential truths. The goal is integration, not victory.

## Exploration, Not Advocacy

This site doesn't claim to have resolved the Hebrew-Greek tension. It invites you into the conversation.

When you see conclusions like "perhaps both are needed" or "maybe the mystery is irreducible," that's not evasion—it's honesty about the limits of human systematization.

We can pursue both:
- **Clarity** AND **humility**
- **Systematic coherence** AND **wrestling with mystery**
- **Confident assurance** AND **humble acknowledgment of what remains beyond our grasp**

## How to Navigate

*"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."* (Revelation 22:13)

Both Greek letters and Hebrew reality. Both systematic order and narrative mystery. Both together point to the One who transcends all our frameworks.
