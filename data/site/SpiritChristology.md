# Spirit Christology: Exhaustive Biblical Evidence

## Introduction

This document catalogs **every relevant biblical text** regarding Jesus's deity, humanity, and relationships with the Father and Holy Spirit. The goal is to present the full biblical data without cherry-picking verses to support predetermined conclusions.

**The Central Question:** Does Scripture present Jesus as an eternally pre-existent second person of the Trinity (Logos Christology), or as the human in whom God's Spirit dwelt fully from conception (Spirit Christology)?

**Methodology:**
- List ALL verses, not selected proof-texts
- Present text with key phrases highlighted
- Minimal commentary - let Scripture speak
- Allow readers to see the full evidence and draw conclusions

---

## 1. Jesus is God

These texts affirm Jesus's deity, divine identity, or divine prerogatives:

### Divine Titles and Names

**John 1:1**
> "In the beginning was the **Word**, and the Word was **with God**, and **the Word was God**."

**John 1:14**
> "And the Word **became flesh** and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."

**John 20:28**
> Thomas answered him, "**My Lord and my God!**"

**Romans 9:5**
> "...the Christ, who is **God over all**, blessed forever. Amen."

**Titus 2:13**
> "...waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**."

**2 Peter 1:1**
> "...through the righteousness of **our God and Savior Jesus Christ**."

**1 John 5:20**
> "...we are in his Son Jesus Christ. **He is the true God** and eternal life."

**Hebrews 1:8**
> But of the Son he says, "**Your throne, O God**, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom."

### "I AM" Statements (YHWH Identity)

**John 8:58**
> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, **before Abraham was, I am**."

*Note: Uses ego eimi (I am) echoing Exodus 3:14 "I AM WHO I AM"*

**John 8:24**
> "I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that **I am he** you will die in your sins."

*Note: "He" is not in the Greek text - literally "I am"*

**John 8:28**
> So Jesus said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that **I am**, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me."

**John 18:5-6**
> They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, **"I am."**... When Jesus said to them, "I am," **they drew back and fell to the ground**.

*Note: The falling response suggests divine presence*

**Revelation 1:17-18**
> "Fear not, **I am the first and the last**, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades."

**Revelation 22:13**
> "**I am the Alpha and the Omega**, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

### Divine Prerogatives

**John 5:21-23**
> "For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, **so also the Son gives life** to whom he will. For the Father judges no one, but **has given all judgment to the Son**, that all may **honor the Son, just as they honor the Father**. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."

*Note: Son receives same honor as Father*

**Matthew 28:18**
> And Jesus came and said to them, "**All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**."

**Colossians 1:16-17**
> For **by him all things were created**, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—**all things were created through him and for him**. And **he is before all things**, and in him all things hold together.

**Hebrews 1:2-3**
> ...but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, **through whom also he created the world**. He is the radiance of the glory of God and **the exact imprint of his nature**, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power.

**John 5:18**
> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but **he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God**.

### Worship Received

**Matthew 28:17**
> And when they saw him they **worshiped him**, but some doubted.

**Luke 24:52**
> And they **worshiped him** and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.

**Hebrews 1:6**
> And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "**Let all God's angels worship him**."

**Philippians 2:9-11**
> Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that **at the name of Jesus every knee should bow**, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and **every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord**, to the glory of God the Father.

**Revelation 5:12-14**
> "**Worthy is the Lamb** who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!" And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, "**To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!**" And the four living creatures said, "Amen!" and the elders fell down and **worshiped**.

*Note: Lamb (Jesus) receives worship alongside God on throne*

### Forgiveness of Sins (Divine Prerogative)

**Mark 2:5-7**
> And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "**Son, your sins are forgiven**." Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, "Why does this man speak like that? **He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?**"

**Luke 7:48-49**
> And he said to her, "**Your sins are forgiven**." Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, "**Who is this, who even forgives sins?**"

### Omniscience

**John 2:24-25**
> But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because **he knew all people** and needed no one to bear witness about man, for **he himself knew what was in man**.

**John 21:17**
> He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, **you know everything**; you know that I love you."

**Colossians 2:3**
> ...in whom are hidden **all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge**.

### Omnipresence

**Matthew 18:20**
> "For where two or three are gathered in my name, **there am I among them**."

**Matthew 28:20**
> "...teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, **I am with you always**, to the end of the age."

### Fullness of Deity

**Colossians 2:9**
> For **in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily**.

**Colossians 1:19**
> For in him **all the fullness of God** was pleased to dwell.

**John 10:30**
> "**I and the Father are one.**"

**John 14:9**
> Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? **Whoever has seen me has seen the Father**. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"

### Pre-existence Claims

**John 1:15**
> (John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, '**He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me**.'"")

**John 17:5**
> "And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence **with the glory that I had with you before the world existed**."

**John 17:24**
> "Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me **because you loved me before the foundation of the world**."

**John 6:62**
> "Then what if you were to see **the Son of Man ascending to where he was before**?"

**Micah 5:2**
> "But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, **whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days**."

**John 3:13**
> "**No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven**, the Son of Man."

### Divine Glory

**John 12:41**
> Isaiah said these things because **he saw his glory** and spoke of him.

*Note: Context is Isaiah 6:1-5 seeing YHWH's glory in the temple*

**John 1:18**
> **No one has ever seen God**; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.

## 2. Jesus is Man

These texts affirm Jesus's full humanity, limitations, development, and human nature:

> But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, **born of woman, born under the law**.

### Human Limitations

**Mark 10:21**
> And Jesus, looking at him, **loved him** and said to him, "You lack one thing..."

### Human Temptation

> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness **to be tempted by the devil**.

**Hebrews 4:15**
> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect **has been tempted as we are**, yet without sin.

**Hebrews 2:18**
> For **because he himself has suffered when tempted**, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

### Death

**Mark 15:37**
> And Jesus uttered a loud cry and **breathed his last**.

> "**Men of Israel**, hear these words: **Jesus of Nazareth, a man** attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know."

**1 Timothy 2:5**
> For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, **the man Christ Jesus**.

## 3. Jesus and the Father

These texts describe the relationship between Jesus and God the Father:

### Distinct Persons

**Matthew 3:16-17**
> And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, **a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."**

*Note: Father speaks while Son is baptized and Spirit descends - three distinct*

**John 17:1**
> When Jesus had spoken these words, **he lifted up his eyes to heaven**, and said, "**Father**, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you."

**Matthew 26:39**
> And going a little farther **he fell on his face and prayed**, saying, "**My Father**, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."

**John 20:17**
> Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending **to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God**.'

**John 11:41-42**
> So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "**Father, I thank you that you have heard me**. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that **you sent me**."

### Sent by the Father

**John 3:16**
> "For God so loved the world, that **he gave his only Son**, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

**John 6:38**
> "For **I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me**."

**John 5:36**
> "But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For **the works that the Father has given me to accomplish**, the very works that I am doing, **bear witness about me that the Father has sent me**."

**John 8:42**
> Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for **I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me**."

**John 17:3**
> "And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and **Jesus Christ whom you have sent**."

**John 17:8**
> "For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that **I came from you**; and **they have believed that you sent me**."

**John 17:18**
> "**As you sent me into the world**, so I have sent them into the world."

**Galatians 4:4**
> But when the fullness of time had come, **God sent forth his Son**, born of woman, born under the law.

### Father Greater, Son Subordinate

**John 14:28**
> "You heard me say to you, 'I am going away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, **for the Father is greater than I**."

**John 5:19**
> So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, **the Son can do nothing of his own accord**, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise."

**John 5:30**
> "**I can do nothing on my own**. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because **I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me**."

**John 8:28**
> So Jesus said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that **I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me**."

**John 12:49**
> "For **I have not spoken on my own authority**, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak."

**1 Corinthians 11:3**
> But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of a wife is her husband, and **the head of Christ is God**.

### Father's Power Working Through Jesus

**Acts 2:22**
> "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you **by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him** in your midst, as you yourselves know."

**Acts 10:38**
> "...how **God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power**. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, **for God was with him**."

**John 14:10**
> "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but **the Father who dwells in me does his works**."

### Unity with Father

**John 10:30**
> "**I and the Father are one.**"

**John 14:9**
> Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? **Whoever has seen me has seen the Father**. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"

**John 14:11**
> "Believe me that **I am in the Father and the Father is in me**, or else believe on account of the works themselves."

**John 17:21-22**
> "...that they may all be one, **just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you**, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one **even as we are one**."

*Note: Believers can share the same kind of "oneness" with Father and Son*

### Dependence on Father

**John 5:26**
> "For as the Father has life in himself, so **he has granted the Son also to have life in himself**."

*Note: Son's life is granted by Father, not inherent*

**Matthew 11:27**
> "**All things have been handed over to me by my Father**, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."

### Exaltation by Father

**Philippians 2:9**
> Therefore **God has highly exalted him** and bestowed on him the name that is above every name.

**Acts 2:33**
> "Being therefore **exalted at the right hand of God**, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing."

**Acts 5:31**
> "**God exalted him at his right hand** as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."

### God of Jesus

**Ephesians 1:3**
> Blessed be **the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

**Ephesians 1:17**
> ...that **the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory**, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him.

**Revelation 3:12**
> "The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of **my God**. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of **my God**, and the name of the city of **my God**, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from **my God** out of heaven, and my own new name."

*Note: Jesus calls the Father "my God" even after resurrection and exaltation*

---

## 4. Jesus and the Spirit

These texts describe the relationship between Jesus and the Holy Spirit:

### Conceived by the Spirit

**Matthew 1:18**
> Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together **she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit**.

**Matthew 1:20**
> But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for **that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit**."

**Luke 1:35**
> And the angel answered her, "**The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you**; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—**the Son of God**."

*Note: Sonship directly connected to Spirit's action*

### Anointed/Filled with the Spirit at Baptism

**Matthew 3:16**
> And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and **he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him**.

**Mark 1:10**
> And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and **the Spirit descending on him like a dove**.

**Luke 3:21-22**
> Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and **the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove**; and a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."

**John 1:32-34**
> And John bore witness: "I saw **the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him**. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and **remain**, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' And I have seen and have borne witness that **this is the Son of God**."

*Critical: John the Baptist did NOT recognize Jesus as Messiah until the Spirit descended and remained*

### Led by the Spirit

**Matthew 4:1**
> Then Jesus was **led up by the Spirit** into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

**Luke 4:1**
> And Jesus, **full of the Holy Spirit**, returned from the Jordan and was **led by the Spirit** in the wilderness.

### Empowered by the Spirit

**Luke 4:14**
> And Jesus returned to Galilee **in the power of the Spirit**, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country.

**Luke 4:18-19**
> "**The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me** to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."

*Note: Jesus quotes Isaiah 61:1 about Spirit anointing*

**Acts 10:38**
> "...how **God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power**. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him."

**Luke 10:21**
> In that same hour **he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit** and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will."

### Ministry Through the Spirit

**Matthew 12:28**
> "But if it is **by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons**, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."

**Luke 11:20**
> "But if it is **by the finger of God** that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."

*Note: "Spirit of God" and "finger of God" used interchangeably*

**Hebrews 9:14**
> ...how much more will the blood of Christ, who **through the eternal Spirit** offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

### Measure of the Spirit

**John 3:34**
> "For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for **he gives the Spirit without measure**."

*Note: Others receive Spirit in measure; Jesus receives without measure*

### Resurrection by the Spirit

**Romans 8:11**
> If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, **he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead** will also give life to your mortal bodies **through his Spirit** who dwells in you.

**1 Peter 3:18**
> For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but **made alive in the spirit**.

### Jesus Sends/Gives the Spirit

**John 14:16**
> "And I will ask the Father, and **he will give you another Helper**, to be with you forever."

**John 14:26**
> "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, **whom the Father will send in my name**, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."

**John 15:26**
> "But when the Helper comes, **whom I will send to you from the Father**, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me."

**John 16:7**
> "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for **if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you**."

*Critical: Jesus must depart before Spirit can come to believers*

**John 20:22**
> And when he had said this, **he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit"**.

**Acts 2:33**
> "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and **having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit**, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing."

### Spirit of Christ

**Romans 8:9**
> You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact **the Spirit of God dwells in you**. Anyone who does not have **the Spirit of Christ** does not belong to him.

*Note: "Spirit of God" and "Spirit of Christ" used interchangeably*

**Philippians 1:19**
> ...for I know that through your prayers and **the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ** this will turn out for my deliverance.

**Galatians 4:6**
> And because you are sons, God has sent **the Spirit of his Son** into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"

**2 Corinthians 3:17**
> Now **the Lord is the Spirit**, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

### Jesus Becomes Life-Giving Spirit

**1 Corinthians 15:45**
> Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; **the last Adam became a life-giving spirit**.

*Note: After resurrection, Jesus described as "life-giving spirit"*

## Observations and Questions

### Key Tensions in the Data:

**1. Deity vs. Limitation:**
- Jesus receives worship, forgives sins, claims divine prerogatives (Section 1)
- Yet Jesus has limited knowledge, grows in wisdom, dies (Section 2)

**2. Pre-existence vs. Birth:**
- "Before Abraham was, I am" and "glory I had with you before the world existed" (Section 1)
- Yet "she gave birth to her firstborn son" and "the child grew and became strong" (Section 2)

**3. Unity vs. Distinction:**
- "I and the Father are one" and "whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (Section 3)
- Yet Jesus prays to Father and says "Father is greater than I" (Section 3)

**4. Spirit Anointing Timeline:**
- Conceived by Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:20, Luke 1:35)
- Spirit descends at baptism (all four Gospels emphasize this)
- John the Baptist didn't recognize Jesus as Messiah until Spirit descended (John 1:33)
- Jesus must depart before Spirit can come to believers (John 16:7)

### Questions for Further Study:

**On Pre-existence:**
- Do "before Abraham" and "glory before the world" refer to eternal Logos/Wisdom/Word (God's eternal self-expression) rather than the man Jesus?
- Is John's prologue (1:1-18) poetic personification like Proverbs 8 (Wisdom with God from beginning)?

**On Baptism:**
- Why does Spirit descend at baptism if Jesus was already fully God incarnate from conception?
- Why didn't John recognize Jesus as Messiah before the Spirit descended and remained?
- What is the significance of "remained" (ἔμεινεν) in John 1:32-33?

**On Spirit and Christ:**
- How can "the Lord is the Spirit" (2 Cor 3:17) coexist with distinct persons in Trinity?
- What does "last Adam became life-giving spirit" (1 Cor 15:45) mean for Jesus's post-resurrection state?
- If Jesus sends the Spirit, how is Spirit a distinct third person?

**On Worship:**
- Can worship of Jesus be worship of God fully present in Jesus without Jesus being second person of eternal Trinity?
- How did first-century monotheistic Jews justify worshiping Jesus?

### Interpretive Frameworks:

**Logos Christology (Traditional):**
- Eternal second person of Trinity (John 1:1)
- Took human nature at conception (John 1:14)
- Two natures (divine and human) in one person
- Pre-existence is personal (Jesus himself existed before Abraham)
- Baptism anointing is empowerment for ministry, not becoming Messiah

**Spirit Christology (Alternative):**
- Logos is God's eternal Word/Wisdom, not second person (like Proverbs 8)
- At conception, God's Spirit fully indwells human Jesus (Luke 1:35)
- Baptism is public manifestation and John's recognition (John 1:33)
- Pre-existence refers to Logos (God's Word), not pre-existent Jesus the man
- "The Lord is the Spirit" (2 Cor 3:17) means Jesus IS God's Spirit embodied

**The Data Supports Both:**
- Both frameworks account for Jesus's deity and humanity
- Both explain worship, miracles, resurrection
- The question: Which requires fewer imported categories?
