title: The Ascension and Return of Christ
shortTitle: Ascension
---
[Jesus](#jesus/jesus 'Parent')
---
"He was taken up." The disciples watched Him rise into the sky until a cloud hid Him. Angels promised: "This Jesus... will come in the same way."

**The question:** Where is Jesus now? What is He doing? Why did He leave? And will He return?

**Greek systematic theology:** Session at the right hand of God. Heavenly intercession. Cosmic sovereignty. Present location and future Parousia.

**Hebrew royal imagery:** Enthronement. The Davidic King takes His throne. The High Priest enters the Holy of Holies. "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."

Between the [resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill') and the return, Jesus reigns.

# The Ascension: The King Enthroned

**Acts 1:9-11:** "As they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, **will come in the same way** as you saw him go into heaven.'"

**The ascension is the hinge between the first and second comings.** Jesus came, died, rose—and then left. He reigns now in heaven, and He will return.

## The Event: What Happened?

### The Forty Days

**Acts 1:3:** "He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them **during forty days** and speaking about the kingdom of God."

**Between resurrection and ascension:** Jesus appeared repeatedly, taught the disciples, ate with them, prepared them for His departure.

**Why forty days?**

**Biblical pattern of forty:**
- **Noah:** Rain for 40 days (Genesis 7:12)
- **Moses:** 40 days on Sinai (Exodus 24:18)
- **Spies:** 40 days exploring Canaan (Numbers 13:25)
- **Elijah:** 40 days journeying to Horeb (1 Kings 19:8)
- **Jesus:** 40 days fasting in wilderness (Matthew 4:2)
- **Israel:** 40 years in wilderness

**Forty = period of testing, preparation, transition.** Jesus used this time to prepare the disciples for the age of the Spirit.

### The Location: Mount of Olives

**Acts 1:12:** "They returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet."

**Luke 24:50:** "He led them out as far as Bethany" (on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives).

**Significance:**

**Zechariah 14:4:** "On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives... Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him."

**Prophecy of the LORD's coming—associated with the Mount of Olives.** Jesus ascends from the same location where Zechariah prophesied the LORD's return.

**Acts 1:11:** "This Jesus... will come in the same way as you saw him go."

**If He left from the Mount of Olives, will He return there?** Early Christians expected it.

### The Moment: Lifted Up

**Acts 1:9:** "He was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight."

**"Lifted up" (Greek: *epērthē*, ἐπήρθη):** Passive—**He was taken up.** Not that He flew, but that **God took Him**.

**"A cloud took him":** Not weather. **Theophanic cloud**—the visible sign of God's presence.

**Exodus 13:21-22:** God led Israel in a pillar of cloud.

**Exodus 24:15-18:** Moses entered the cloud on Sinai—God's glory.

**Exodus 40:34-35:** The cloud of God's glory filled the tabernacle.

**1 Kings 8:10-11:** The cloud filled Solomon's temple when the ark entered.

**Daniel 7:13:** "With the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days."

**Mark 14:62:** Jesus at His trial: "You will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and **coming with the clouds of heaven**."

**The cloud is God's chariot.** Jesus enters the glory-cloud and is taken into God's presence.

### The Response: Looking Up

**Acts 1:10:** "While they were gazing into heaven as he went..."

**Angels' rebuke:** "Why do you stand looking into heaven?"

**They were staring at the sky, hoping to see more.** But the vision was over. Jesus was gone.

**The angel's promise:** "This Jesus... will come in the same way."

**Ascension points to return.** He left visibly; He will return visibly.

## Greek Systematic Framework: Where Is He? What Is He Doing?

### 1. The Right Hand of God

**Psalm 110:1:** "The LORD says to my Lord: '**Sit at my right hand**, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"

**Most quoted OT verse in the NT.** Applied to Jesus' ascension and session (sitting at God's right hand).

**Acts 2:33-35 (Peter at Pentecost):** "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God... David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand..."'"

**Hebrews 1:3:** "After making purification for sins, he **sat down at the right hand** of the Majesty on high."

**Hebrews 10:12:** "When Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he **sat down at the right hand of God**."

**Mark 16:19:** "The Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and **sat down at the right hand of God**."

**Romans 8:34:** "Christ Jesus... who was raised from the dead... is **at the right hand of God**, who indeed is interceding for us."

**Ephesians 1:20:** God "raised him from the dead and **seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places**."

#### What Does "Right Hand of God" Mean?

**Not literal location.** God is spirit (John 4:24), doesn't have a physical right hand.

**Metaphor for:**
- **Authority:** The king's right hand = place of power (1 Kings 2:19).
- **Favor:** To sit at the king's right hand = highest honor.
- **Shared rule:** To sit on a throne = to reign.

**Jesus sits at God's right hand = He reigns with divine authority.**

**But where is this "right hand"? Where is heaven?**

**Greek philosophy asks:** What is the location? Is it a place? Another dimension?

**Hebrew imagery answers:** It's not about spatial location, but **reality**. Jesus entered God's dimension—the realm where God dwells, which transcends our space-time.

**Colossians 3:1:** "Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."

**Hebrews 9:24:** "Christ has entered... into **heaven itself**, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf."

**Heaven = the presence of God.** Jesus is there, fully human and fully divine, reigning.

### 2. Heavenly High Priest

**Hebrews is the NT book most focused on Jesus' current heavenly ministry.**

#### The Earthly Pattern

**Old Covenant:** The high priest entered the Holy of Holies once a year (Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur) to offer blood for sins (Leviticus 16).

**The tabernacle/temple:** A copy of the heavenly reality (Hebrews 8:5, Exodus 25:40).

**Two rooms:**
1. **Holy Place:** Daily ministry
2. **Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies):** God's presence, once a year

**Only the high priest could enter the inner room, and only with blood.**

#### The Heavenly Fulfillment

**Hebrews 9:11-12:** "When Christ appeared as a high priest... he entered **once for all into the holy places**, not by means of the blood of goats and calves **but by means of his own blood**, thus securing an eternal redemption."

**The ascension = Jesus entering the heavenly Holy of Holies.**

**Not with animal blood, but with His own blood (shed on the cross).**

**Not annually, but once for all.**

**Hebrews 9:24:** "Christ has entered, not into holy places **made with hands**, which are copies of the true things, but **into heaven itself**, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf."

**The cross = the altar.** Jesus was both priest and sacrifice.

**The ascension = entering the sanctuary.** Jesus brings His blood into God's presence, securing eternal atonement.

**The result:** Access to God is opened for all believers.

**Hebrews 10:19-22:** "We have confidence to enter the holy places **by the blood of Jesus**, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh... let us draw near..."

**Jesus' ascension means we can now enter God's presence.**

#### Ongoing Intercession

**Hebrews 7:25:** "He is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since **he always lives to make intercession** for them."

**Romans 8:34:** "Christ Jesus... is at the right hand of God, who indeed is **interceding for us**."

**What does Jesus' intercession look like?**

**Not:** Jesus begging the Father to be merciful.

**But:** Jesus, the perfect High Priest, standing in God's presence on our behalf, His finished work constantly effective.

**Hebrews 9:24:** "To appear in the presence of God **on our behalf**."

**His presence itself is intercession.** He is the mediator (1 Timothy 2:5). Through Him, we have access.

**John 14:6:** "No one comes to the Father except through me."

### 3. Cosmic Lordship

**Ephesians 1:20-23:** God "raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, **far above all rule and authority and power and dominion**, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And he **put all things under his feet** and gave him as head over all things to the church."

**Philippians 2:9-11:** "God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him **the name that is above every name**, so that at the name of Jesus **every knee should bow**, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, to the glory of God the Father."

**Matthew 28:18:** "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."

**1 Corinthians 15:25:** "He must reign **until** he has put all his enemies under his feet."

#### Already and Not Yet

**Jesus is reigning now (already):**
- Seated at God's right hand
- All authority given to Him
- Head over all things

**But His reign isn't fully manifest (not yet):**
- Evil still exists
- Death still claims lives
- His enemies aren't yet vanquished

**Hebrews 2:8:** "We do **not yet** see everything in subjection to him."

**1 Corinthians 15:25:** "He must reign **until** he has put all his enemies under his feet."

**Psalm 110:1:** "Sit at my right hand, **until** I make your enemies your footstool."

**The ascension inaugurates His reign. The second coming consummates it.**

**Between ascension and return = the church age, the age of the Spirit, the time of mission.**

### 4. The Gift of the Spirit

**Jesus' departure enabled the Spirit's arrival.**

**John 16:7:** "It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you."

**Why couldn't the Spirit come while Jesus was on earth?**

**Possible answers:**

**a. The mission required both.** Jesus' earthly work (incarnation, [atonement](#jesus/atonement 'Greek'), [resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill')) had to be finished before the Spirit could apply it globally.

**b. Jesus' physical presence was limited.** He could only be in one place. The Spirit's presence is universal—with all believers everywhere.

**c. The Spirit is sent in Jesus' name (John 14:26).** The ascension and glorification of Jesus precede the Spirit's mission.

**Acts 2:33 (Peter at Pentecost):** "Being therefore **exalted at the right hand of God**, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, **he has poured out** this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing."

**Ascension → Exaltation → Outpouring of the Spirit.**

**John 7:39:** "Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for **as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified**."

**Jesus' glorification (ascension) is the trigger for the Spirit's coming at Pentecost.**

## Hebrew Royal and Priestly Imagery: Enthronement and Access

### 1. The Davidic King Enthroned

**Psalm 110:1:** "The LORD says to my **Lord** (Hebrew: *Adonai*): 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"

**Hebrew royal psalm:** The king is enthroned, awaiting victory over enemies.

**Applied to Jesus:** The [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew'), the Son of David, has taken His throne.

**Acts 2:30-36 (Peter):** "Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about **the resurrection of the Christ**... Being therefore **exalted at the right hand of God**... Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both **Lord and Christ**, this Jesus whom you crucified."

**The resurrection + ascension = enthronement.** Jesus is now reigning as the Davidic King.

**2 Samuel 7:12-13:** God's promise to David: "I will raise up your offspring after you... and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."

**The ascension fulfills this.** Jesus reigns on David's throne—not a physical throne in Jerusalem (yet), but the heavenly throne, ruling over all creation.

**Luke 1:32-33 (Gabriel to Mary):** "The Lord God will give to him **the throne of his father David**, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."

**Revelation 3:21:** "The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me **on my throne**, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne."

**Jesus shares God's throne.** He reigns with divine authority.

### 2. "Until I Make Your Enemies Your Footstool"

**Psalm 110:1:** The king sits, waiting for God to subdue his enemies.

**1 Corinthians 15:25-26:** "He must reign **until** he has put all his enemies under his feet. **The last enemy to be destroyed is death**."

**The ascension begins the reign. The return completes it.**

**Between now and then:** Jesus is reigning, but His enemies are being subdued progressively.

**Hebrew imagery:** A king doesn't fight all battles personally. He delegates. He commissions.

**The church is the king's army.** We proclaim His victory, extend His kingdom, until He returns to finalize it.

**Matthew 28:18-20 (Great Commission):** "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. **Go therefore** and make disciples of all nations... teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, **I am with you always**, to the end of the age."

**The ascended King commissions His people and promises His presence (by the Spirit) until the end.**

### 3. The High Priest in the Holy of Holies

**Leviticus 16:** The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once a year with blood for atonement.

**Hebrews 9:7:** "Into the second [room] only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood."

**Hebrews 9:12:** "He entered once for all into the holy places... by means of his own blood."

**The ascension = Jesus entering the true Holy of Holies (heaven), bringing His own blood, securing eternal atonement.**

**Result:** The veil is torn (Matthew 27:51). Access to God is opened.

**Hebrews 10:19-20:** "We have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us **through the curtain**."

**Jesus' ascension means we can enter God's presence.** Prayer is now direct access—no earthly high priest needed.

### 4. The Cloud and the Glory

**Exodus 13:21:** "The LORD went before them... in a pillar of cloud."

**Exodus 40:34-35:** "The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."

**1 Kings 8:10-11:** "When the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD, and the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for **the glory of the LORD filled the house**."

**The cloud = God's presence, His Shekinah glory.**

**Acts 1:9:** "A cloud took him out of their sight."

**Jesus enters the glory-cloud—the visible presence of God.** He is received into God's glory.

**This is vindication.** The one crucified as cursed is now enthroned in God's glory.

## The Return: He Will Come Again

**Acts 1:11:** "This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, **will come in the same way** as you saw him go."

**The ascension promises the return.**

### New Testament Testimony

**Matthew 24:30:** "They will see **the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven** with power and great glory."

**Mark 13:26:** "They will see the Son of Man **coming in clouds** with great power and glory."

**1 Thessalonians 4:16-17:** "The [Lord](#jesus/lord 'Hebrew') himself will **descend from heaven** with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air."

**Revelation 1:7:** "Behold, **he is coming with the clouds**, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him."

**Revelation 19:11-16:** "I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True... **The armies of heaven** were following him... On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, **King of kings and Lord of lords**."

**Titus 2:13:** "Waiting for our blessed hope, **the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**."

**2 Thessalonians 1:7-10:** "When the Lord Jesus is **revealed from heaven** with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God... on that day when he comes to be glorified in his saints."

### The Parousia

**Greek: *parousia* (παρουσία) = presence, coming, arrival.**

**Used for Jesus' return:**

**Matthew 24:27:** "As the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be **the coming** of the Son of Man."

**1 Corinthians 15:23:** "Each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at **his coming** those who belong to Christ."

**1 Thessalonians 2:19:** "What is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus **at his coming**?"

**James 5:7-8:** "Be patient, therefore, brothers, until **the coming of the Lord**... for **the coming of the Lord** is at hand."

**2 Peter 3:4:** "Where is the promise of **his coming**?"

### What Will Happen at the Return?

#### 1. Visible, Bodily Return

**Acts 1:11:** "In the same way as you saw him go" = visibly, bodily, to earth.

**Not a spiritual coming. Not a metaphor.** Physical return, as physical as the ascension.

**Revelation 1:7:** "Every eye will see him."

#### 2. Resurrection of the Dead

**1 Corinthians 15:23:** "Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ."

**1 Thessalonians 4:16:** "The dead in Christ will rise first."

**John 5:28-29:** "An hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."

**Resurrection of believers to life, resurrection of unbelievers to judgment.**

#### 3. Final Judgment

**Matthew 25:31-32:** "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered **all the nations**, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."

**2 Corinthians 5:10:** "We must all appear before **the judgment seat of Christ**."

**Revelation 20:11-15:** The great white throne judgment. Books opened. Dead judged. Death and Hades thrown into the lake of fire.

#### 4. Renewal of Creation

**Romans 8:19-21:** "The creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God... the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption."

**2 Peter 3:10-13:** "The heavens will pass away with a roar... the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed... we are waiting for **new heavens and a new earth** in which righteousness dwells."

**Revelation 21:1-5:** "I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away... Behold, I am making all things new."

**Not escape from creation, but renewal of creation.**

#### 5. Defeat of All Enemies

**1 Corinthians 15:24-26:** "Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. **The last enemy to be destroyed is death.**"

**Revelation 20:10:** Satan thrown into the lake of fire.

**Revelation 20:14:** "Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire."

**Victory complete. Evil vanquished. Death destroyed.**

#### 6. Eternal Reign

**Revelation 11:15:** "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and **he shall reign forever and ever**."

**Revelation 22:3-5:** "The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it [the new Jerusalem], and his servants will worship him... And they will reign forever and ever."

**The ascended King will reign eternally in the new creation.**

## Tensions and Questions

### 1. When Will He Return?

**Jesus:** "Concerning that day or that hour, **no one knows**, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only" (Matthew 24:36).

**Acts 1:7:** "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority."

**The early church expected it soon.** Paul, Peter, John wrote as if it could happen in their lifetimes.

**2,000 years later, He hasn't returned.**

**2 Peter 3:3-9:** Scoffers say, "Where is the promise of his coming?" Peter's answer: "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise... but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish."

**God's timing isn't our timing.** Delay is mercy, giving time for repentance.

**But the promise stands:** He will return.

### 2. How Can a Body Be in "Heaven"?

**Greek philosophy struggles:** Heaven is immaterial, spiritual. How can a physical body exist there?

**Responses:**

**a. Jesus' resurrection body is transformed—"spiritual body" (1 Corinthians 15:44).** Physical, but no longer subject to normal limitations.

**b. "Heaven" isn't just an immaterial realm.** It's the dimension where God dwells. Jesus' body fits there because it's glorified.

**c. The final state isn't disembodied heaven.** It's **new earth**—physical, renewed creation where resurrected bodies dwell eternally.

**The ascension isn't Jesus leaving physicality behind. It's Him entering God's presence as the incarnate Son—fully human, fully divine, forever.**

### 3. Why Did He Leave?

**If Jesus is reigning, why isn't He here visibly?**

**Answers:**

**a. The Spirit's mission.** John 16:7—"If I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you."

**b. The Great Commission.** The church is sent to make disciples of all nations. If Jesus reigned visibly from Jerusalem, the mission wouldn't happen the same way.

**c. Faith, not sight.** 2 Corinthians 5:7—"We walk by faith, not by sight." The current age is the age of faith. The age to come will be sight.

**d. The Father's timing.** Psalm 110:1—"Sit at my right hand, **until** I make your enemies your footstool." The waiting period is part of the plan.

### 4. What Is Jesus Doing Now?

**Summary:**

**1. Reigning** (seated at God's right hand, all authority, cosmic Lord)

**2. Interceding** (heavenly High Priest, appearing before God on our behalf)

**3. Sending the Spirit** (exalted, He pours out the Spirit on the church)

**4. Building His church** (Matthew 16:18—"I will build my church")

**5. Subduing enemies** (progressively putting all things under His feet, awaiting final victory)

**6. Preparing a place** (John 14:2-3—"I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again and will take you to myself")

**He is not absent.** He is present by the Spirit, active in the church, reigning over all.

**Matthew 28:20:** "I am with you always, to the end of the age."

## Eilu V'Eilu: Holding the Tensions

Perhaps the ascension is both:
- **Departure** (He left, cloud hid Him, He's in heaven)
- **Presence** (He's with us by the Spirit, active in the church)

Perhaps Jesus is both:
- **Spatially in heaven** (at God's right hand, not physically on earth)
- **Universally present** (by the Spirit, "I am with you always")

Perhaps His reign is both:
- **Already** (all authority given, enthroned, victorious)
- **Not yet** (enemies not fully subdued, awaiting return)

**Greek systematic theology maps it out:** Session, intercession, parousia, intermediate state, millennium (or not), final judgment, new creation.

**Hebrew testimony proclaims:** He ascended. He reigns. He will return. "Even so, come, Lord Jesus" (Revelation 22:20).

**Both are needed.** Greek categories help us understand the timeline and mechanics. Hebrew worship keeps the focus on the person and the hope.

**Perhaps the ascension is not primarily a doctrine to systematize, but a promise to embrace.**

**Perhaps the question isn't "Where exactly is Jesus now?" but "Is He reigning? And will He return?"**

**And the answer is:**

**He is seated at the right hand of God.**

**He is interceding for us.**

**He is pouring out His Spirit.**

**He is building His church.**

**And He will come again.**

**Acts 1:11:** "This Jesus... will come in the same way as you saw him go."

**Revelation 22:20:** "Surely I am coming soon."

**Amen. Come, [Lord](#jesus/lord 'Hebrew') Jesus.**
