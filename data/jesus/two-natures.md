[Jesus](#jesus/jesus 'Parent')

How can Jesus be both fully God and fully man?

**Greek solution:** Two complete natures (divine and human) united in one person (hypostatic union). Defined at Council of Chalcedon (451 AD).

**Hebrew testimony:** The Son, filled with the [Spirit of God](#spirit/ruach 'Hebrew'), was born, lived, died, and rose. "The Word became flesh" (John 1:14). The mystery remains.

**The question:** Does the Greek formulation ("two natures, one person") illuminate Scripture, or does it import categories that create problems Scripture doesn't have?

The [incarnation](#jesus/incarnation 'Hebrew') may be simpler in Hebrew thought: God's ruach fully indwelling the human nephesh Jesus—God's presence embodied—without requiring Greek "nature" categories that oppose divine/human.

# The Two Natures of Christ

Jesus is God. Jesus is man. How can both be true?

## The Early Church Controversies

The New Testament affirms both:
- **Jesus is God:** John 1:1 ("The Word was God"), John 20:28 ("My Lord and my God"), Colossians 2:9 ("In him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily")
- **Jesus is man:** Born, grew, hungry, tired, wept, suffered, died

But **how** can one person be both?

### Early Heresies (Attempts to Resolve the Tension)

**1. Docetism (1st-2nd century)**
- Jesus only *seemed* human
- His body was an illusion or appearance
- Rejected: Denies real incarnation, makes the cross a trick

**2. Ebionism (1st-2nd century)**
- Jesus was only human, adopted by God at baptism
- Not eternally divine
- Rejected: Denies deity, makes Jesus just a good man

**3. Arianism (4th century, Arius)**
- Jesus is the first and greatest creation, but not fully God
- "There was when He was not"
- Rejected at Council of Nicaea (325): Jesus is "begotten, not made, of one substance with the Father"

**4. Apollinarianism (4th century, Apollinaris)**
- Jesus had a human body but divine mind/soul
- Not fully human—the Logos replaced His human mind
- Rejected: If He didn't assume a full human nature, He didn't redeem full humanity

**5. Nestorianism (5th century, Nestorius)**
- Two separate persons (divine and human) loosely joined
- Mary is mother of the human Jesus, not mother of God (*Theotokos*)
- Rejected at Council of Ephesus (431): Jesus is one person, not two

**6. Eutychianism/Monophysitism (5th century)**
- Jesus had one nature (divine + human = mixed nature)
- His humanity was absorbed into His deity
- Rejected: Denies full humanity

## The Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD)

To settle the debate, the Council of Chalcedon defined orthodox Christology:

**Jesus Christ is:**
1. **One person** (not two persons joined together)
2. **Two natures** (fully divine and fully human)
3. **Without confusion** (the natures don't mix into a third thing)
4. **Without change** (neither nature loses its properties)
5. **Without division** (you can't separate the person into two)
6. **Without separation** (the union is permanent)

**The formula:**
"We confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same **perfect in Godhead** and also **perfect in manhood**; truly God and truly man... recognized **in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation**; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and coming together to form one person."

## The Hypostatic Union

**Hypostasis** (ὑπόστασις) = person, concrete existence

**The doctrine:** Two complete natures (divine and human) united in one person (the person of the Son).

**Not:**
- One person + one nature (Eutychianism)
- Two persons + two natures (Nestorianism)
- One person + partial natures (Apollinarianism)

**But:** One person + two complete natures

### What Does "Two Natures" Mean?

**Nature** = the set of properties that make something what it is.

**Divine nature includes:**
- Omniscience (all-knowing)
- Omnipotence (all-powerful)
- Omnipresence (present everywhere)
- Impassibility (cannot suffer or change)
- Eternity (no beginning or end)
- Immutability (unchanging)

**Human nature includes:**
- Limited knowledge
- Limited power
- Located in one place at a time
- Ability to suffer and experience emotion
- Temporal existence (born, grows, ages)
- Changeable

**The claim:** Jesus has *both* sets of properties simultaneously.

## The Problems with Two Natures

### 1. Logical Contradictions

How can one person be:
- Omniscient and limited in knowledge?
- Omnipresent and located in one place?
- Impassible and able to suffer?
- Eternal and born in time?
- Immutable and growing/changing?

**Traditional response:** The two natures are distinct. The divine nature knows all; the human nature knows finitely. The person of Christ acts through both natures.

**Problem:** But the person is the agent. Does Jesus (the person) know all things or not?

**Example:** Mark 13:32—"Concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."

- If Jesus is omniscient (divine nature), He knows the day.
- If Jesus doesn't know (human nature), He's not omniscient.
- Which is it?

**Chalcedonian answer:** According to His human nature, He doesn't know. According to His divine nature, He does.

**Objection:** This divides the person. Is there one consciousness or two? If Jesus the person doesn't know, then He's not omniscient. If He does know, then His statement is false.

### 2. Which Nature Does What?

When Jesus acts, which nature is acting?

**Traditional framework (communicatio idiomatum—"communication of properties"):**
- Actions are attributed to the person, but performed through one nature or the other
- Jesus (the person) died, but death affected only the human nature (God can't die)
- Jesus (the person) created the universe, but through the divine nature (humans can't create ex nihilo)

**Problem:** This seems to split Jesus into two agents. When He gets tired, that's the human nature. When He calms a storm, that's the divine nature. But the New Testament presents one person doing all of it.

### 3. The Incarnation: Change or No Change?

**The claim:** The Son (second person of the Trinity) became incarnate.

**Problem:** If God is immutable (unchanging), how can the Son "become" anything?

**Option 1:** The Son didn't change. He assumed a human nature, but His divine nature remained unchanged.

**Objection:** But the person of the Son went from "not incarnate" to "incarnate." That's a change.

**Option 2:** The divine nature doesn't change, but the person of the Son (the hypostasis) did take on something new.

**Objection:** If the person changed (by adding humanity), then the person isn't immutable. And the person is divine, so divinity changed.

**Chalcedon's careful language:** The natures unite "without change" (to preserve immutability) but the person is incarnate (which seems to require change).

### 4. Can God Die?

**Good Friday:** Jesus died on the cross.

**But:** God is immortal, immutable, impassible. God cannot die.

**Chalcedonian answer:** Jesus (the person) died. The human nature died. The divine nature cannot die, so it remained alive while united to the dead human body.

**Problem:** If the divine nature didn't die, did Jesus really die? Or did half of Him die?

**The New Testament claims:** God died. "They crucified the Lord of glory" (1 Corinthians 2:8). Not just "the human nature of the Lord of glory."

**Paradox:** If God cannot die, how did God die? Chalcedon affirms both (God died, God cannot die) without resolving the tension.

## Theological Functions of Two Natures

Why does the church insist on both natures?

### 1. Atonement Requires Both

**Full humanity:** Only a human can die for humans. Substitutionary [atonement](#jesus/atonement 'Greek') requires a human representative.

**Full deity:** Only God's sacrifice has infinite worth. A mere human death can't atone for infinite sin against infinite God.

**Result:** Jesus must be both to save us.

**But:** This is a *theological* reason, not a philosophical resolution of the contradiction.

### 2. Mediation Requires Both

**1 Timothy 2:5:** "There is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."

To mediate between God and humanity, Jesus must be connected to both—fully God, fully man.

### 3. Redemption of Humanity

**Gregory of Nazianzus:** "What has not been assumed has not been healed."

If Jesus didn't assume full human nature (body, soul, mind, will), He didn't redeem full humanity.

**This is why Apollinarianism was rejected:** If the Logos replaced Jesus' human mind, then human minds aren't redeemed.

## Eastern Orthodox Emphasis: Theosis

**Western focus:** How do two natures coexist in one person? (Ontological question)

**Eastern focus:** The Incarnation enables **theosis** (deification)—humans participating in divine nature.

**2 Peter 1:4:** "Partakers of the divine nature."

**Athanasius:** "God became man so that man might become god."

Not that we become God in essence, but that we're united to God and transformed by His life.

**Eastern approach:** The mystery of the hypostatic union isn't primarily a puzzle to solve, but the foundation for our union with God.

## Hebrew Tensions: The Paradox Held

Hebrew thought doesn't frame the question as "How can two natures unite?"

**The testimony:**
- This man healed the sick, calmed storms, raised the dead
- This man hungered, wept, suffered, died
- This man rose from the dead
- This man is called "Lord" and "God" and receives worship
- This man is the [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew'), the [Suffering Servant](#jesus/servant 'Hebrew'), the Son of Man

**The result:** He must be both God and man. How? The text doesn't explain. It testifies.

**Not:** Here's the philosophical mechanism (two natures, one person, hypostatic union).

**But:** Here's what happened. Here's who He is. The mystery remains.

### Philippians 2:6-8

"Though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."

**Greek reading:** The divine nature remained unchanged, but took on a human nature. "Emptied" means veiled His glory, not diminished His deity.

**Hebrew reading:** God genuinely became human. "Emptied" might mean He set aside divine prerogatives, became truly limited. The mystery of how God can do this is left unresolved.

### John 1:14

"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."

**Not:** "The Word appeared to be flesh."

**Not:** "The Word adopted a human body."

**But:** "The Word *became* flesh."

**How can the eternal Logos become temporal flesh?** The verse doesn't explain. It testifies to the event.

## Implications

**1. God Knows Suffering**

If Jesus is fully God and fully man, and Jesus suffered, then God knows suffering from the inside.

This challenges Greek [impassibility](#god/impassibility 'Greek') (God cannot suffer). Chalcedon affirms both (God is impassible, Jesus suffered). The tension remains.

**2. Humanity Is Taken Into God**

The [Incarnation](#jesus/incarnation 'Drill') isn't temporary. Jesus remains human forever (glorified, resurrected, but human).

Human nature is now united to God permanently. This is the foundation for resurrection hope.

**3. The Limits of Definition**

Chalcedon defines what's *not* true (no confusion, no division) more than what *is* true.

**Negative theology:** We know what Jesus is not (not two persons, not one nature), but the positive mystery of how two natures unite in one person is beyond full comprehension.

Perhaps this is as it should be. Perhaps the church's task is not to resolve the mystery but to guard it—rejecting false explanations while holding the tension Scripture presents.

Perhaps the question "How can Jesus be both God and man?" is answered not with Greek philosophy, but with Hebrew testimony: "I saw Him. I touched Him. He is Lord."
