*Jesus* - God made flesh, crucified and risen.

**Greek approach:** Define nature.
- [Two Natures](#jesus/two-natures 'Greek'): How is Jesus both God and man? Hypostatic union.
- [Atonement Theories](#jesus/atonement 'Greek'): How does His death save? Penal substitution, satisfaction, moral influence.
- [Offices](#jesus/offices 'Greek'): Prophet, Priest, King - threefold role.

**Hebrew approach:** *Yeshua* (ישוע) - "YHWH saves." Narrative of promise and fulfillment.
- [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew'): Anointed one, Davidic king, deliverer who comes.
- [Suffering Servant](#jesus/servant 'Hebrew'): Isaiah 53 - wounded for our transgressions.
- [Lord](#jesus/lord 'Hebrew'): *Kurios* = YHWH. Resurrection vindication, exalted name.

**Both traditions explore:**
- [Incarnation](#jesus/incarnation 'Drill'): Word made flesh. God enters creation.
- [Resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill'): Bodily raising. Death defeated.
- [Ascension and Return](#jesus/ascension 'Drill'): Where is He now? Will He come again?

**Handout:** [What Does It Mean to Be the Son of God?](#handouts/son-of-god.md 'Drill') — Five views, one question.

Can we approach Him through definitions, or only through [testimony](#bible/testimony 'Hebrew')?
