"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14).

**Incarnation** (from Latin *in carne*, "in flesh"): God became human.

**Greek questions:** How can God become man without changing? How do [two natures](#jesus/two-natures 'Greek') unite? What is the mechanism?

**Hebrew wonder:** God with us. *Emmanuel*. The infinite entering the finite. Tabernacling among His people. Not *how*, but *that* He came.

Both traditions agree: This is the hinge of history. God entered His creation.

# The Incarnation: God With Us

**John 1:14:** "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."

**The claim:** The eternal God became a human being. Not appeared as human (Docetism). Not indwelt a human (Adoptionism). **Became human.**

**This is the central miracle of Christianity.** Not just that God is powerful (other religions affirm that), but that God became one of us.

## The Word: Logos and Memra

### Greek: Logos

**John 1:1:** "In the beginning was the Word (*Logos*, Λόγος), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

**Greek philosophy (Stoics, Philo):** *Logos* = divine reason, ordering principle of the cosmos, the rational structure of reality.

**Philo of Alexandria (Jewish philosopher, contemporary with Jesus):** The *Logos* is God's intermediary with creation—His wisdom, Word, agent of creation.

**John's use:** The *Logos* isn't an impersonal principle, but a person—the Son. He's both "with God" (distinct) and "was God" (divine).

### Hebrew: Memra

**Targums (Aramaic paraphrases of Hebrew Bible):** Often substitute "the *Memra* (Word) of the LORD" when God acts.

**Example (Genesis 3:8 in Targum Onkelos):** "They heard the voice of the *Memra* of the LORD God walking in the garden."

**Function:** *Memra* is a way to speak of God's presence and action without directly saying YHWH appeared (to preserve transcendence).

**Parallel to John 1:** The Word (*Memra*/*Logos*) is God's self-expression, His presence, His creative power.

**John 1:3:** "All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made."

**The *Logos* is the agent of creation:** Genesis 1—"God said..." (Word creates). John 1—"Through the Word all things were made."

## The Event: "Became Flesh"

**John 1:14:** "The *Logos* became (*egeneto*, ἐγένετο) flesh."

**Not:**
- Appeared *as* flesh (Docetism)
- Took *on* flesh like a garment (Apollinarianism)
- Indwelt a human temporarily (Adoptionism)

**But: Became.** The eternal Word entered into human existence—took on human [nature](#jesus/two-natures 'Greek').

**Galatians 4:4:** "When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, **born of woman**, born under the law."

**Philippians 2:6-7:** "Though he was in the form of God... he emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, **being born in the likeness of men**."

**Hebrews 2:14:** "Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, **he himself likewise partook of the same things**."

**Flesh** (*sarx*, σάρξ)—not just "body," but full humanity: physical, mortal, vulnerable.

**Jesus wasn't a demigod** (half-god, half-man). He was fully God and fully man. The mystery of the incarnation is that He's *both*.

## Why Did God Become Human?

### 1. To Reveal God

**John 1:18:** "No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, **he has made him known**."

**John 14:9:** "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father."

**Hebrews 1:1-3:** "In these last days [God] has spoken to us by his Son... He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature."

**Human problem:** We can't see God. He's invisible, transcendent, beyond us.

**God's solution:** He shows Himself in terms we can grasp—a human face, human words, human actions.

**Jesus is God's self-revelation.** Want to know what God is like? Look at Jesus.

### 2. To Save Humanity

**1 Timothy 1:15:** "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."

**Why did God have to become human to save us?**

**Anselm's answer (11th century, *Cur Deus Homo*):**
- Only a human can represent humanity (substitute)
- Only God can offer infinite satisfaction for sin
- Therefore, the Savior must be both God and man

**Athanasius (4th century):** "God became man so that man might become god" (meaning *theosis*—participation in divine life, not becoming divine in essence).

**Gregory of Nazianzus:** "What has not been assumed has not been healed."

If Jesus didn't take on full human nature (body, soul, mind, will), He didn't redeem full humanity.

**Incarnation is essential to [atonement](#jesus/atonement 'Greek'):** Jesus had to be human to die for humans, and divine for His death to have infinite worth.

### 3. To Defeat Death

**Hebrews 2:14-15:** "Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, **that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death**, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery."

**Christus Victor:** God became human to enter the realm of death, destroy it from within, and rise victorious.

**Jesus didn't defeat death from a distance.** He entered it. He died. And in dying, He broke death's power.

### 4. To Be Our High Priest

**Hebrews 4:15:** "We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."

**Jesus understands suffering, temptation, weakness—because He experienced them.**

**Hebrews 5:8:** "Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered."

**The incarnation makes Jesus a merciful and faithful high priest.** He's not a distant deity unmoved by our pain. He knows it personally.

### 5. To Fulfill Israel's Story

**Jesus is the true Israel:** Where Israel failed, Jesus succeeded.

**Israel's exodus:** Passed through water (Red Sea), tested in wilderness 40 years, entered Promised Land.

**Jesus' recapitulation:** Baptized in water (Jordan), tested in wilderness 40 days, obedient where Israel failed.

**Matthew 2:15:** "Out of Egypt I called my son" (quoting Hosea 11:1, about Israel, applied to Jesus).

**Jesus embodies Israel's calling:** To be God's obedient son, God's servant, God's anointed king.

**The incarnation isn't just about rescuing individuals—it's about fulfilling God's covenant promises to Israel and through Israel to the world.**

## "Dwelt Among Us": Tabernacle Language

**John 1:14 (literal):** "The Word became flesh and **tabernacled** (*eskēnōsen*, ἐσκήνωσεν) among us."

**Allusion to Exodus 25:8:** "Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may **dwell** (*shakan*, שָׁכַן) in their midst."

**Tabernacle (Hebrew *mishkan*, from same root as *shakan*):** The tent where God's glory dwelt among Israel in the wilderness.

**Shekinah (שְׁכִינָה):** Rabbinic term for God's presence—from the same root.

**John's point:** Jesus is the new tabernacle. God's glory dwells not in a tent, but in a person.

**John 2:19-21:** "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up... He was speaking about the temple of his body."

**Jesus replaces the temple.** God's presence is now in Him. To encounter God, you encounter Jesus.

## The Virgin Birth

**Matthew 1:18-25, Luke 1:26-38:** Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary.

### Why Virgin Birth?

**1. Fulfills prophecy**
Isaiah 7:14 (Matthew 1:22-23): "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (God with us).

(Note: Hebrew *almah* = young woman, can mean virgin. Greek LXX uses *parthenos* = virgin.)

**2. Sign of divine action**
The incarnation isn't natural generation. It's a miraculous act of God. The Spirit "overshadows" Mary (Luke 1:35)—like the Shekinah cloud overshadowing the tabernacle (Exodus 40:35).

**3. Jesus' divine origin**
Born of woman (fully human), but conceived by the Spirit (divine). No human father—His Father is God.

**4. Sinless nature**
Some traditions (Augustinian) link virgin birth to sinlessness: Jesus didn't inherit [original sin](#man/original-sin 'Greek') because He had no human father.

*Problem:* Does this imply sin is passed through the father? Scripture doesn't say that.

*Better answer:* Jesus is sinless not because of the mechanics of His birth, but because He's the eternal Son incarnate.

### Objections to Virgin Birth

**Historical-critical scholars:** Parallels to pagan myths (gods impregnating women). Virgin birth is later legend.

**Response:**
- Jewish context: No pagan parallels in Second Temple Judaism. Pagans had gods having sex with women—very different from the Spirit overshadowing Mary.
- Early attestation: Matthew and Luke (independent sources) both affirm virgin birth. Not late legend.
- Theological necessity: If Jesus is God incarnate, normal human generation doesn't fit. The incarnation is miraculous.

**Liberal theology:** Virgin birth is unnecessary. Jesus could be Savior without miraculous birth.

**Orthodox response:** The incarnation *is* miraculous. If God became man, a miraculous birth is fitting. Denying the virgin birth often leads to denying Jesus' deity.

## Kenosis: "He Emptied Himself"

**Philippians 2:6-7:** "Though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but **emptied himself**, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."

**Greek:** *ekenōsen* (ἐκένωσεν)—from *kenoō*, "to empty."

**Kenosis theory (19th-20th century):** Jesus "emptied" Himself of divine attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence) to become truly human.

**Problem:** If He gave up divine attributes, is He still fully God? Chalcedon says the divine nature doesn't change.

**Alternative reading:** Jesus didn't empty Himself *of* deity, but emptied Himself *by taking on* humanity. The emptying is the incarnation itself—the humiliation of becoming human, not the loss of divinity.

**Philippians 2:8:** "He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."

**The kenosis is the descent:** From glory to humiliation, from throne to manger, from heaven to cross.

## Implications

**1. God is not distant**

The incarnation means God entered the mess of human existence—birth, hunger, fatigue, temptation, suffering, death.

**God isn't an unmoved mover watching from outside.** He came *in*.

**2. Humanity is dignified**

If God became human, humanity is good—not a prison for the soul, but something God Himself took on.

**Material creation matters.** God affirmed it by joining it.

**3. Suffering is not foreign to God**

Greek philosophy: God is impassible—He cannot suffer, feel pain, or be affected by creation.

**But the incarnation:** God suffered. Jesus wept (John 11:35), was troubled (John 12:27), cried out in agony (Mark 15:34).

**Does this contradict [impassibility](#god/impassibility 'Greek')?** The divine nature is impassible, but the incarnate Son suffered in His human nature.

**Or:** Maybe impassibility needs rethinking. If God in Christ suffered, maybe God is more relational, more involved, more affected by His creatures than Greek categories allow.

**4. Salvation is personal, not just transactional**

The incarnation isn't just God sending a payment. It's God *coming Himself*—entering our condition, bearing our sin, defeating our death.

**Salvation is God with us, not just God for us.**

**5. The incarnation is permanent**

Jesus didn't stop being human after the ascension.

**He remains incarnate forever:** Glorified, resurrected, but still human.

**At God's right hand is a man—Jesus.**

**Hebrews 7:25:** "He always lives to make intercession for them."

**Revelation 5:6:** In heaven, John sees "a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain."

**The incarnation is not temporary.** God united Himself to humanity permanently.

## Greek and Hebrew Perspectives

**Greek framework:** Asks *how* the incarnation works. Two natures, one "person" (hypostasis). Kenosis theories. [Hypostatic union](#jesus/two-natures 'Greek')—Greek philosophical categories applied to the mystery.

**Strength:** Provides categories, guards against certain heresies.

**Weakness:** Can feel abstract, philosophical. The incarnation becomes a puzzle to solve, not a wonder to worship. May import dualistic categories (divine vs. human) that create problems Scripture doesn't have.

**Hebrew framework:** Testifies *that* God came. *Emmanuel*—God with us. The Word tabernacled among us. We saw Him. We touched Him (1 John 1:1). The Son, filled with the Spirit, walked among us.

**Strength:** Keeps the focus on encounter, relationship, testimony.

**Weakness:** Doesn't answer the philosophical questions. Leaves tensions unresolved.

**Both are needed.** Greek categories prevent misunderstanding. Hebrew testimony preserves the wonder.

**Perhaps the incarnation isn't meant to be fully understood.** Perhaps it's a mystery that invites worship, not just explanation.

**1 Timothy 3:16:** "Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: **He was manifested in the flesh**, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory."

**Mystery.** Not a problem to solve, but a reality to receive.

**The Word became flesh.**

**God with us.**

**Emmanuel.**
