*Kurios* (Κύριος) = Lord. In the Septuagint (Greek OT), *Kurios* translates *YHWH* (יהוה), the personal name of God.

**When the NT calls Jesus "Lord," it's not just a title of respect.**

**It's identifying Jesus with YHWH—the God of Israel.**

"Jesus is Lord" (Romans 10:9) = Jesus is YHWH. Worship belongs to Him. The [resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill') vindicates this claim.

The question: How can a man be YHWH?

# Lord: Jesus and YHWH

"If you confess with your mouth that **Jesus is Lord** and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9).

**"Jesus is Lord"** was the earliest Christian confession. But what does "Lord" mean?

**Greek:** *Kurios* (Κύριος)—can mean "master," "sir," or "lord" (authority figure).

**But in Jewish usage:** *Kurios* is the Greek word for **YHWH** (יהוה), the personal, covenant name of God.

**When early Christians (who were Jews) called Jesus *Kurios*, they were making an astounding claim:** Jesus is YHWH, the God of Israel.

## YHWH: The Name of God

**Exodus 3:13-15:** Moses asks God, "What is your name?"

God answers: "I AM WHO I AM" (*Ehyeh asher ehyeh*, אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה). "Say this to the people of Israel: **'I AM has sent me to you.'** The LORD (*YHWH*), the God of your fathers... this is my name forever."

**YHWH** (יהוה)—the tetragrammaton, God's personal covenant name.

**Meaning:** "He is" or "He causes to be"—the self-existent, eternal God.

**Uniqueness:** YHWH is God's name, not just a title. It distinguishes Him from all other gods.

**Deuteronomy 6:4 (Shema):** "Hear, O Israel: The LORD (*YHWH*) our God, the LORD (*YHWH*) is one."

**God's name is sacred.** By the Second Temple period, Jews stopped pronouncing YHWH out of reverence. When reading Scripture aloud, they substituted *Adonai* (אֲדֹנָי, "Lord") instead.

## Septuagint: YHWH → Kurios

**Septuagint (LXX):** Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, completed ~250-150 BC.

**When translators encountered YHWH, they used *Kurios* (Κύριος, "Lord").**

**Result:** Greek-speaking Jews understood *Kurios* as the equivalent of YHWH.

**Examples:**
- Psalm 110:1 (Hebrew): "YHWH says to my Lord (*Adonai*)..."
- Psalm 110:1 (LXX): "*Kurios* says to my *kurios*..."

**Isaiah 45:23 (Hebrew):** "To me every knee shall bow" (YHWH speaking).
**Isaiah 45:23 (LXX):** "To me every knee shall bow" (*Kurios*).

**For Jews reading the Septuagint, *Kurios* = YHWH = the one true God.**

## New Testament: Jesus is Kurios

The NT calls Jesus *Kurios* repeatedly—over 700 times.

**Sometimes it's just respectful:** "Sir" (John 4:11, 15—Samaritan woman calls Jesus *kurios* as a polite address).

**But often it's theological:** A claim that Jesus is YHWH.

### 1. Romans 10:9

"If you confess with your mouth that **Jesus is Lord** (*Kurios*) and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

**Context (Romans 10:13):** "Everyone who calls on the name of the *Lord* will be saved"—quoting Joel 2:32, where "Lord" = YHWH.

**Paul's claim:** Calling on Jesus' name = calling on YHWH's name. Jesus is YHWH.

### 2. Philippians 2:9-11

"God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the **name that is above every name**, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow... and every tongue confess that **Jesus Christ is Lord** (*Kurios*)."

**Allusion to Isaiah 45:23** (YHWH speaking): "To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance."

**Paul applies YHWH's claim to Jesus:** Jesus receives the worship due to YHWH.

### 3. 1 Corinthians 8:6

"Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and **one Lord, Jesus Christ**, through whom are all things and through whom we exist."

**Echoes Deuteronomy 6:4 (Shema):** "The LORD (*YHWH*) our God, the LORD is one."

**Paul's restatement:** One God (Father), one Lord (Jesus). Jesus is included within the identity of YHWH.

**Not two gods, but the one God identified as Father and Son.**

### 4. John 20:28

**Thomas's confession:** "My Lord and my God!" (*Ho kurios mou kai ho theos mou*, Ὁ κύριός μου καὶ ὁ θεός μου).

Thomas explicitly calls Jesus both *Lord* and *God*. Jesus doesn't correct him.

### 5. Hebrews 1:10

Quoting Psalm 102:25-27 (addressed to YHWH): "You, Lord (*Kurios*), laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning."

**The author applies this to Jesus.** YHWH created the world; Jesus created the world. Jesus is YHWH.

### 6. Acts 2:36

**Peter at Pentecost:** "Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both **Lord** and **Christ**, this Jesus whom you crucified."

**"Lord"** here isn't just "master." It's the title reserved for YHWH. Peter is claiming: Jesus is the covenant Lord of Israel.

## Old Testament Passages Applied to Jesus

The NT repeatedly takes OT passages about YHWH and applies them to Jesus.

**Isaiah 40:3 (YHWH coming):**
"A voice cries: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of *YHWH*; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'"

**Applied to Jesus (Mark 1:3):**
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the *Lord*'"—John the Baptist preparing the way for Jesus.

**Joel 2:32 (calling on YHWH):**
"Everyone who calls on the name of *YHWH* shall be saved."

**Applied to Jesus (Romans 10:13, Acts 2:21):**
"Everyone who calls on the name of the *Lord* [Jesus] will be saved."

**Psalm 110:1 (YHWH and the Messiah):**
"*YHWH* says to my Lord (*Adonai*): 'Sit at my right hand.'"

**Applied to Jesus (Acts 2:34-35, Hebrews 1:13):**
Jesus is the Lord seated at God's right hand.

**The pattern:** Texts about YHWH are now about Jesus. The NT identifies Jesus with YHWH.

## Worship of Jesus

**Only YHWH is to be worshiped.**

**Deuteronomy 6:13:** "You shall fear the LORD (*YHWH*) your God. You shall serve him and swear by his name."

**Jesus Himself affirms this (Matthew 4:10):** "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve."

**But the NT shows Jesus receiving worship:**

**Matthew 28:9:** The women "took hold of [Jesus'] feet and worshiped him."

**John 9:38:** The blind man healed by Jesus: "Lord, I believe." And he worshiped him.

**Hebrews 1:6:** "Let all God's angels worship him" (speaking of Jesus).

**Revelation 5:13-14:** The Lamb (Jesus) receives worship alongside the One on the throne (the Father). "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!"

**If Jesus isn't YHWH, this is idolatry.** But the NT presents it as right and proper.

**Conclusion:** Jesus is worthy of worship because He is YHWH.

## Jewish Monotheism and Christian Claims

**Jewish objection:** You claim to be monotheists ("Hear, O Israel: YHWH our God, YHWH is one"), but you worship Jesus alongside God. That's polytheism.

**Christian response:** We worship one God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus isn't a second god; He's the eternal Son, sharing the one divine nature. (See [Trinity](#god/trinity 'Greek'))

**But this raises the question:** How can Jesus be YHWH if the Father is YHWH? Are there two YHWHs?

**Orthodox answer:** No. There is one YHWH, eternally existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Three persons, one God.

**Hebrew framework tension:** Does this preserve monotheism, or does it functionally introduce multiple gods under the label "persons"?

**Jewish response:** This is not monotheism. Calling Jesus "Lord" and worshiping Him violates the Shema.

**Christian insistence:** It is monotheism. Jesus isn't a separate god—He's the eternal Word made flesh, YHWH Himself entering creation.

## Resurrection as Vindication

**The claim that Jesus is Lord would be blasphemy—unless God vindicated it.**

**How?** The [resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill').

**Romans 1:3-4:** Jesus "was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."

**"Declared to be Son of God... by his resurrection."**

Not: He became Son of God at resurrection.
But: Resurrection demonstrated and vindicated who He always was—the Son, the Lord.

**Acts 2:32-36:** Peter's argument:
1. God raised Jesus from the dead (v. 32)
2. Jesus is exalted to God's right hand (v. 33)
3. Psalm 110:1 ("YHWH says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand'") is fulfilled in Jesus (vv. 34-35)
4. **Conclusion:** "God has made him both Lord and Christ" (v. 36)

**Resurrection proves:** Jesus' claims were true. He is Lord. The title isn't presumption—it's reality.

**If Jesus stayed dead,** calling Him "Lord" (YHWH) would be blasphemy. He'd be just another failed messianic claimant.

**But He rose.** And the resurrection vindicates His identity: YHWH has come in the flesh, died, and conquered death.

## "Maranatha" - The Aramaic Prayer

**1 Corinthians 16:22:** "If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!" (*Maranatha*, Μαρανα θα).

**Aramaic:** *Marana tha* (מָרַנָא תָא) = "Our Lord, come!"

**Significance:** Aramaic was the language of Jesus and the earliest Jewish Christians. This prayer predates Paul's letters—it's one of the oldest Christian liturgical phrases.

**They prayed to Jesus:** "Come, Lord Jesus" (Revelation 22:20).

**Jews prayed only to YHWH.** Praying to Jesus means they identified Him as YHWH.

**Within a decade of the crucifixion,** Aramaic-speaking Jewish Christians were calling Jesus "Lord" and praying for His return.

**This isn't later Gentile invention.** It's rooted in the earliest Jewish Christian community.

## The Name Above Every Name

**Philippians 2:9:** "God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him **the name that is above every name**."

**What name?** *Kurios* (Lord)—the name of YHWH.

**Not a new name, but the recognition of His true identity.**

Jesus always was YHWH. The incarnation didn't make Him God—it revealed God in human flesh.

**Exaltation doesn't mean He became God.** It means He's enthroned, vindicated, and publicly declared to be who He always was: **Lord**.

## Implications

**1. Jesus is YHWH incarnate**

The NT doesn't just say Jesus represents God or reveals God. It identifies Jesus *as* God—specifically, as YHWH, the covenant Lord of Israel.

**2. Christian monotheism is Trinitarian**

We worship one God: Father, Son, and Spirit. Not three gods, but one God in three persons.

**This stretches Hebrew monotheism without breaking it:** YHWH is one, but eternally exists as Father, Son, and Spirit.

**Or does it break it?** Jewish theology says yes. Christian theology says no. The tension remains.

**3. Worship of Jesus is appropriate**

If Jesus is YHWH, then worshiping Him isn't idolatry—it's obedience. "At the name of Jesus every knee should bow" (Philippians 2:10).

**4. Salvation comes through calling on the name of the Lord**

"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved" (Romans 10:13).

In the OT, that's YHWH. In the NT, that's Jesus. Because Jesus *is* YHWH.

**5. The resurrection is essential**

Without the resurrection, calling Jesus "Lord" is blasphemy. The resurrection vindicates the claim.

**Paul:** "If Christ has not been raised... we are even found to be misrepresenting God" (1 Corinthians 15:14-15).

If Jesus is still dead, we're liars. But He rose. Therefore, He is Lord.

## The Unresolved Tension for Jews

**For Christians:** Jesus is YHWH. "Lord" isn't just a title—it's His identity. He's the God of Israel, come in flesh.

**For Jews:** This is impossible. YHWH is one. YHWH doesn't become human. Calling a man "YHWH" violates the Shema.

**Christian response:** We affirm the Shema. YHWH is one. But YHWH exists eternally as Father, Son, and Spirit. The incarnation doesn't compromise God's oneness—it reveals His complexity.

**Jewish response:** That's polytheism wrapped in philosophical language. A man can't be YHWH.

**Stalemate.** Both sides affirm monotheism. But they define it differently.

**Perhaps the question is:** Can YHWH enter His own creation? Can the infinite become finite without ceasing to be infinite?

**Greek philosophy says no:** God is immutable, impassible, transcendent. He can't become human.

**Hebrew testimony says yes:** The Angel of the LORD appears to Abraham, wrestles with Jacob, speaks from the burning bush—YHWH present, yet distinct.

**Christian claim:** That presence, that Angel, that Word—became flesh in Jesus.

**"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:1, 14).**

**YHWH with us. Emmanuel. Lord.**

**Perhaps the greatest mystery of the Christian faith isn't *how* Jesus is Lord, but *that* He is.**

**And perhaps the response isn't a system, but a confession:**

**"My Lord and my God."**
