What does Jesus do?

**Greek systematic approach:** Three offices (Prophet, Priest, King) systematize Christ's work.

- **Prophet:** Reveals God, speaks God's word
- **Priest:** Mediates between God and humanity, offers sacrifice
- **King:** Rules, judges, reigns

**Hebrew framework:** [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew') (anointed one) fulfills roles promised in Scripture. Less systematic categories, more fulfillment of specific covenantal expectations.

# The Three Offices of Christ

**Reformation doctrine (Calvin especially):** Christ fulfills three Old Testament offices—Prophet, Priest, and King.

**Purpose:** Systematize what Christ does by connecting Him to OT roles that were anointed (with oil, symbolizing the Spirit).

**Hebrew:** *Mashiach* (מָשִׁיחַ) = Anointed One. Prophets, priests, and kings were anointed. Jesus is the ultimate Anointed One—the [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew').

## 1. Christ as Prophet

### Old Testament Prophets

**Role:** Speak God's word to the people. "Thus says the LORD..."

**Moses:** The archetypal prophet (Deuteronomy 18:15-18).

**Prophets after Moses:** Called by God, spoke His word, often confronted kings and people with God's judgment and promise.

**Anointing:** Elijah anointed Elisha (1 Kings 19:16). Some prophets explicitly anointed, others called directly.

### Christ the Prophet

**Deuteronomy 18:15:** "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen."

**Fulfillment:**
- John 6:14—"This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world."
- Acts 3:22-23—Peter identifies Jesus as the prophet Moses foretold.

**Jesus reveals God:**
- John 1:18—"No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known."
- Hebrews 1:1-2—"Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son."

**Jesus speaks with authority:**
- Matthew 7:28-29—"The crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes."
- "You have heard that it was said... but I say to you..." (Matthew 5:21-48)

**Not just a prophet, but the final Prophet:**
- He doesn't say "Thus says the LORD"—He says "I say to you."
- He is the Word made flesh (John 1:14), the ultimate revelation of God.

**Application:**
- We listen to Jesus as God's final word.
- All prophecy points to Him; He fulfills and completes revelation.

## 2. Christ as Priest

### Old Testament Priests

**Role:** Mediate between God and people. Offer sacrifices. Enter the Holy Place (and once a year, the High Priest enters the Most Holy Place).

**Levitical priesthood:** Descendants of Aaron, from the tribe of Levi.

**Function:**
1. Offer sacrifices for sin (Leviticus 1-7)
2. Intercede for the people (Leviticus 16—Day of Atonement)
3. Maintain the tabernacle/temple
4. Teach the Law

**Anointing:** Priests were anointed with oil (Exodus 29:7, Leviticus 8:12).

### Christ the Priest

**Hebrews 4:14-16:** "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession... Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace."

**Hebrews 7-10:** Jesus is a priest in the order of Melchizedek (not Levitical).

**Melchizedek** (Genesis 14:18-20, Psalm 110:4):
- King of Salem (Jerusalem), priest of God Most High
- Blessed Abraham, received tithes from him
- No genealogy listed (Hebrews 7:3)—eternal priesthood

**Christ's priesthood is superior to Levitical:**

**1. Eternal, not temporary**
- Levitical priests died and were replaced
- Christ lives forever (Hebrews 7:23-24)

**2. Perfect, not repeated**
- Levitical priests offered sacrifices daily
- Christ offered Himself once for all (Hebrews 7:27, 9:12, 10:10)

**3. Effective, not symbolic**
- Animal blood couldn't truly take away sins (Hebrews 10:4)
- Christ's blood cleanses completely (Hebrews 9:14)

**Christ is both priest and sacrifice:**
- Priests offered animals
- Christ offered Himself (Hebrews 9:26)

**Christ's current priestly work:**
- **Intercession:** Hebrews 7:25—"He always lives to make intercession for them."
- **Advocacy:** 1 John 2:1—"If anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."

**Application:**
- We have direct access to God through Christ (Hebrews 10:19-22)
- No need for human mediators—Christ is our only mediator (1 Timothy 2:5)

## 3. Christ as King

### Old Testament Kings

**Role:** Rule God's people, lead in war, administer justice.

**Anointing:** Saul, David, Solomon, and subsequent kings were anointed with oil (1 Samuel 10:1, 16:13, 1 Kings 1:39).

**Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7:12-16):**
- God promises David that his descendant will reign forever
- "I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever" (v. 13)

**Problem:** The Davidic line ended with the Babylonian exile (586 BC). Where is the eternal king?

**Prophetic expectation:**
- Isaiah 9:6-7—"Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom."
- Jeremiah 23:5—"I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king."

### Christ the King

**Born as King:**
- Matthew 2:2—"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?"
- Luke 1:32-33—"The Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever."

**Crucified as King:**
- John 19:19—Pilate's inscription: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
- Jesus told Pilate: "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36).

**Resurrected and exalted as King:**
- Philippians 2:9-11—"God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name."
- Revelation 19:16—"King of kings and Lord of lords."

**Already and not yet:**
- **Already:** Christ reigns now, seated at the Father's right hand (Ephesians 1:20-22, Hebrews 1:3)
- **Not yet:** His kingdom will be consummated at His return (Revelation 11:15)

**Application:**
- We submit to King Jesus now
- We await His return to fully establish His kingdom
- His kingdom is not political (like earthly kings), but spiritual—yet it will one day encompass all creation

## Synthesis: The Threefold Office

**Why three offices?**

**1. Covers Christ's work comprehensively:**
- **Prophet:** Revelation (He reveals God to us)
- **Priest:** Reconciliation (He reconciles us to God)
- **King:** Rule (He reigns over us)

**2. Shows fulfillment of OT:**
All three offices were anointed → Jesus is the ultimate Anointed One (Messiah/Christ)

**3. Distinguishes Christ's work from confusion:**
- Not just a prophet (also priest and king)
- Not just a priest (also prophet and king)
- Not just a king (also prophet and priest)

### Lutheran and Reformed Distinctions

**Lutherans:**
- Emphasize the "states" of Christ (humiliation and exaltation) more than offices
- Christ emptied Himself (kenosis) in incarnation, was exalted in resurrection

**Reformed (Calvin especially):**
- Emphasize the threefold office to systematize Christ's work
- Used to structure Christology and soteriology

**Both affirm:** Christ is prophet, priest, and king. The difference is emphasis.

## Hebrew Framework: Messiah as Fulfillment

**Hebrew thought doesn't start with three abstract offices.**

It starts with **promises** in the covenant:
- God promised a prophet like Moses
- God established the priesthood through Aaron
- God promised an eternal king from David's line

**The question:** How will God fulfill these promises?

**The answer (Christian reading):** Jesus is the fulfillment of all three.

**Not:** "Let's categorize Christ's work into three offices."

**But:** "Look—He's the prophet Moses foretold, the priest after Melchizedek, the king from David's line. He's the [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew')."

**Testimony over taxonomy:** The NT doesn't systematize Christ into offices. It testifies that He fulfills the roles Scripture promised.

### Multiple Images, Not Just Three

The NT uses many images for who Jesus is:
- Lamb of God (John 1:29)
- Son of Man (Mark 2:10)
- Son of God (Mark 1:1)
- Servant (Philippians 2:7)
- High Priest (Hebrews 4:14)
- Shepherd (John 10:11)
- Bridegroom (Matthew 9:15)
- Vine (John 15:5)
- Bread of Life (John 6:35)
- Light of the World (John 8:12)
- The Way, the Truth, the Life (John 14:6)

**The threefold office captures some of this, but not all.**

**Greek instinct:** Systematize into categories (prophet, priest, king).

**Hebrew instinct:** Pile up images, each revealing a facet. Don't reduce to a system.

### Anointing and the Spirit

**All three offices involved anointing with oil, symbolizing the Spirit:**
- Prophets: Empowered by the Spirit to speak God's word (2 Peter 1:21)
- Priests: Set apart by anointing (Exodus 29:7)
- Kings: Anointed with oil, empowered by the Spirit (1 Samuel 16:13)

**Jesus:**
- Conceived by the Spirit (Luke 1:35)
- Baptized and the Spirit descends on Him (Matthew 3:16)
- "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me" (Luke 4:18, quoting Isaiah 61:1)

**Acts 10:38:** "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power."

**Christ** (Χριστός) = **Messiah** (מָשִׁיחַ) = **Anointed One**

The title itself declares: He's anointed for all three roles (and more).

## Implications

**1. Christ is sufficient**

We don't need other mediators. He's the only prophet, priest, and king we need.

**2. Christ's work is comprehensive**

He reveals God (prophet), reconciles us to God (priest), and rules our lives (king). Salvation touches every aspect of existence.

**3. The threefold office unites OT and NT**

Jesus fulfills what the OT foreshadowed.

**4. We share in Christ's offices (in a derivative sense)**

- **Prophetic:** We proclaim the gospel (1 Peter 2:9)
- **Priestly:** We offer spiritual sacrifices (Romans 12:1, 1 Peter 2:5)
- **Royal:** We reign with Christ (Revelation 5:10, 20:6)

**But:** Our participation is dependent on His. He's the true prophet, priest, and king. We're anointed only because we're in Him.

## The Limits of Systematization

**The threefold office is helpful:**
- Organizes Christ's work
- Connects OT and NT
- Clarifies His roles

**But it's not exhaustive:**
- It doesn't capture every NT image
- It can make Christ's work feel abstract (categories instead of person)
- The NT doesn't explicitly teach "three offices"—this is a theological construct

**Hebrew approach:** Start with testimony ("We've seen the [Lord](#jesus/lord 'Hebrew')"), not taxonomy ("Here are His three offices").

**Greek approach:** Organize testimony into system ("Here's how His roles work").

**Both are valuable.** Systematization helps understanding. Testimony preserves encounter.

Perhaps the question isn't "Which office is primary?" but "Who is He?"

And perhaps the answer is not a list of roles, but a name: **Jesus, the Christ, the Anointed One—our Prophet, Priest, and King.**
