shortTitle: Messiah

[Jesus](#jesus/jesus 'Parent')

*Mashiach* (מָשִׁיחַ) = Anointed One. Greek: *Christos* (Χριστός) = Christ.

**Jewish expectation:** The Messiah will be a descendant of David, anointed king who will restore Israel, defeat enemies, bring peace, and establish God's kingdom.

**Problem:** Jesus was crucified by Rome. He didn't overthrow the oppressors. He didn't restore the kingdom. How is He the Messiah?

**Christian answer:** Already and not yet. First coming: Suffering [Servant](#jesus/servant 'Hebrew'). Second coming: Conquering King. Two advents, one Messiah.

Jewish objection: That's not what Messiah means.

# Messiah: The Anointed One

**"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" (Mark 14:61)**

**"Yes, I am."** Jesus' answer led to His crucifixion for blasphemy.

But what does **Messiah** (Christ) mean? What were Jews expecting? Did Jesus fulfill it—or redefine it?

## The Word "Messiah"

**Hebrew:** *Mashiach* (מָשִׁיחַ) = Anointed One

**Greek translation:** *Christos* (Χριστός) = Christ

**"Jesus Christ"** isn't first name + last name. It's **Jesus the Messiah**—Jesus, the Anointed One.

### Anointing in the Old Testament

**Who was anointed?**
1. **Priests** (Exodus 29:7, Leviticus 8:12)
2. **Kings** (1 Samuel 10:1—Saul, 1 Samuel 16:13—David)
3. **Prophets** (1 Kings 19:16—Elisha)

**The act:** Oil poured on the head, symbolizing God's Spirit and consecration for a role.

**Result:** The anointed person is set apart for God's purposes.

**Cyrus the Persian** is even called "anointed" (Isaiah 45:1) because God used him to deliver Israel—though he wasn't Israelite.

**But "The Messiah" became shorthand for one specific expectation:** The coming Davidic king who will restore Israel.

## The Davidic Covenant

**2 Samuel 7:12-16:** God's promise to David.

"When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you... and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and **I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever**... Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. **Your throne shall be established forever**."

**The promise:** A descendant of David will reign forever.

**Solomon fulfilled it partially:** He built the temple, reigned in peace. But his kingdom didn't last forever. It split after his death.

**Babylonian exile (586 BC):** The Davidic line ended. No king on the throne.

**The question:** How will God keep His promise?

**Prophetic hope:** God will raise up a Davidic king in the future.

### Messianic Prophecies

**Isaiah 9:6-7:**
"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder... Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore."

**Isaiah 11:1-5:**
"There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him... He shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked."

**Jeremiah 23:5-6:**
"Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely."

**Ezekiel 37:24-25:**
"My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd... David my servant shall be their prince forever."

**Not the historical David (long dead), but a future Davidic king—the Messiah.**

## Second Temple Jewish Expectations

**What were Jews expecting in Jesus' time?**

**1. A Davidic King**
- Descendant of David
- Anointed by God
- Restores the throne of Israel

**2. Military and Political Deliverance**
- Overthrows foreign oppressors (Rome in the 1st century)
- Liberates Israel from exile/subjugation
- Restores national sovereignty

**3. Gathering of Exiles**
- Brings scattered Jews back to the land
- Reunites the twelve tribes

**4. Establishment of Peace and Justice**
- Isaiah's vision: Swords beaten into plowshares (Isaiah 2:4)
- Righteous judgment, prosperity, blessing

**5. Restoration of the Temple**
- Some expected the Messiah to rebuild or purify the temple
- Presence of God dwelling with His people

**6. Gentile inclusion (some expectations)**
- Isaiah 2:2-3, 49:6—Nations stream to Zion, worship the God of Israel
- But still centered on Israel's restoration

**Rabbinic texts (later, but reflecting earlier traditions):**

*Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98a-99a:* Debates about when Messiah will come, what he'll do. Varied opinions, but generally: a king who will restore Israel.

*Eighteen Benedictions (Amidah):* Daily Jewish prayers in Second Temple period included petitions for the coming of the Messiah and restoration of Davidic kingship.

**Key point:** The Messiah was expected to be a triumphant king, not a suffering servant. Victory, not crucifixion.

## Jesus' Messianic Claims

**Did Jesus claim to be the Messiah?**

### Indirect Claims

Jesus often avoided the title "Messiah" publicly, perhaps because it carried political/military expectations He didn't fulfill.

**Mark 8:27-30:** "Who do you say that I am?" Peter: "You are the Christ." Jesus: "Tell no one."

Why the secrecy? Likely because people expected a military Messiah. Jesus' mission was different.

**Preferred title:** "Son of Man" (Daniel 7:13-14)—a figure who receives authority from God, but without the immediate political connotations of "Messiah."

### Direct Claim

**Mark 14:61-62:** The high priest asked, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"

Jesus: "I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."

**Result:** Condemned for blasphemy. Handed over to Rome. Crucified.

**The charge on the cross:** "The King of the Jews" (Mark 15:26).

**Irony:** He was executed for claiming to be the Messiah, but He was the Messiah—just not the kind they expected.

### Messianic Actions

**1. Entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday)**
- Riding a donkey (Zechariah 9:9—"Your king is coming to you... humble and mounted on a donkey")
- Crowds shouting "Hosanna" (Save us) and "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David" (Mark 11:9-10)
- **Clear Messianic symbolism**

**2. Cleansing the Temple**
- Overturning tables, driving out money changers (Mark 11:15-17)
- Prophetic act claiming authority over the temple
- Messianic expectation: purify or restore the temple

**3. Healing and Miracles**
- Isaiah 35:5-6—Signs of the Messianic age: "The eyes of the blind shall be opened, the ears of the deaf unstopped, the lame man leap like a deer."
- Jesus' miracles signaled: The Messianic age has come

**4. Claiming to Forgive Sins**
- Mark 2:5-7—"Your sins are forgiven." Scribes: "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
- Implicit divine authority—fitting for the Messiah (God's anointed representative)

## The Problem: A Crucified Messiah?

**Jewish expectation:** The Messiah conquers. He doesn't get defeated.

**What happened:** Jesus was arrested, tried, mocked, crucified by Rome.

**Deuteronomy 21:23:** "Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree."

**To first-century Jews:** A crucified Messiah is a contradiction in terms. The Messiah is blessed, victorious, anointed by God. Crucifixion means cursed by God.

**1 Corinthians 1:23:** "We preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles."

**Why stumbling block?** Because Messiah doesn't lose. If He died, He wasn't the Messiah.

**Christian response:** The [resurrection](#jesus/resurrection 'Drill') vindicates Him. God raised Him from the dead, proving He is the Messiah despite the crucifixion.

But this required redefining "Messiah" to include suffering.

## Christian Reinterpretation: Suffering Before Glory

**Early Christians faced the problem:** Jesus didn't fulfill the political/military expectations. He didn't overthrow Rome. He didn't restore Israel's kingdom.

**Solution:** Read the OT again and see two stages of the Messiah:

### First Coming: Suffering Servant

**Isaiah 53:** The [Suffering Servant](#jesus/servant 'Hebrew')—despised, rejected, wounded for our transgressions, killed.

**Traditional Jewish reading:** This is Israel (the servant = the nation). Or a prophet.

**Christian reading:** This is the Messiah—first coming in humility, suffering for sin.

**Psalm 22:** "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (quoted by Jesus on the cross, Mark 15:34)—suffering, mocked, hands and feet pierced.

**Zechariah 12:10:** "They will look on me, on him whom they have pierced."

**Christian claim:** The OT predicted a suffering Messiah, but Jews missed it because they focused on the glory passages.

### Second Coming: Conquering King

**The passages about Messiah's reign, victory, and peace** aren't forgotten—they're future.

**Already:** Jesus inaugurated the kingdom in His first coming (healing, teaching, defeating sin and death through the cross and resurrection).

**Not yet:** He will return to consummate the kingdom (Revelation 19-22, Davidic reign fully realized).

**Two advents, one Messiah.**

### Apostolic Preaching

**Acts 2:22-36 (Peter at Pentecost):**
- Jesus performed miracles (Messianic signs)
- You crucified Him
- God raised Him from the dead (vindication)
- He's exalted at God's right hand (Psalm 110:1—Davidic king enthroned)
- **Conclusion:** "Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both [Lord](#jesus/lord 'Hebrew') and Christ."

**Acts 3:18:** "What God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled."

**Not:** "We were wrong about the Messiah."

**But:** "We misunderstood the timeline. Suffering comes before glory."

## Jewish Objections

**Objection 1: Messiah doesn't die**

**Christian response:** He died, but rose. Death didn't defeat Him—He defeated death.

**Jewish counter:** Resurrection is eschatological (end of the age), not something that happens to one person in the middle of history.

**Objection 2: Messiah restores Israel politically**

**Christian response:** The kingdom is spiritual first (already), political later (not yet).

**Jewish counter:** That's redefining "kingdom" to avoid the obvious—Jesus didn't fulfill the prophecies.

**Objection 3: Messianic age brings universal peace**

**Christian response:** Inner peace with God now (reconciliation), external peace when He returns.

**Jewish counter:** Isaiah 2:4 says "nation shall not lift up sword against nation." That hasn't happened. The prophecies weren't fulfilled.

**Objection 4: Temple still standing in Messianic age**

**Christian response:** Jesus is the new temple (John 2:19-21). His body, the church, is the temple (1 Corinthians 3:16, Ephesians 2:21).

**Jewish counter:** That's spiritualizing away literal prophecies. The physical temple was supposed to be restored and remain.

**Objection 5: All Israel will know God**

**Jeremiah 31:34:** "No longer shall each one teach his neighbor... saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me."

**Christian response:** This will be fulfilled when Jesus returns (Romans 11:26—"All Israel will be saved").

**Jewish counter:** But it was supposed to happen with Messiah's coming, not be deferred to a second coming.

## Rabbinic Judaism's Response

After 70 AD (destruction of the Second Temple), rabbinic Judaism developed without a temple, without a Davidic king, and without Jesus.

**Messianic hope continued**, but focused on:
- Waiting for the Messiah (still future)
- Obedience to Torah in the meantime
- Rejection of Jesus as a false Messiah (didn't fulfill the prophecies, led people astray)

*Talmud, Sanhedrin 43a:* Mentions Jesus (Yeshu) being executed on Passover eve for sorcery and leading Israel astray.

**Jewish position:** Jesus may have claimed to be Messiah, but the evidence shows He wasn't. The Messiah hasn't come yet.

## The Hebrew Christian Tension

**For Jews who followed Jesus:** He is the Messiah, but He fulfilled it in an unexpected way.

**The challenge:** Hold together:
1. Jesus is the promised Davidic king
2. Jesus didn't restore Israel politically
3. Jesus will return to complete the restoration

**Already/not yet:** Essential to Christian theology, but a stumbling block to Jews who expected a single, complete fulfillment.

## Implications

**1. The kingdom is upside-down**

The Messiah comes first in weakness, then in strength. First to serve, then to reign. First the cross, then the crown.

**Matthew 20:28:** "The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

**2. Suffering is redemptive**

The greatest act of the Messiah wasn't conquering Rome, but conquering sin and death through His own suffering.

**3. The Messianic age has begun, but isn't complete**

We live in the "already/not yet" tension. The kingdom has come (Mark 1:15), but we still pray "Your kingdom come" (Matthew 6:10).

**4. The question remains open for Jews**

**For Christians:** Jesus fulfilled the prophecies (in stages).

**For Jews:** Jesus didn't fulfill the prophecies (plain reading of the texts).

**Eilu v'eilu?** Not quite. One side is right, the other wrong. But the tension reminds us: Messianic expectation is more complex than either side admits.

Perhaps the question isn't just "Did Jesus fulfill the prophecies?" but "What does it mean to be Messiah?"

And perhaps the answer is: **Jesus redefined Messiah.** Not by abandoning the Davidic hope, but by embodying it in a way no one expected—Servant before King, Cross before Crown, Resurrection as the hinge between.

**Christian confession:** Jesus is the Christ. The Anointed One. The Messiah. David's greater Son. The King who reigns from a cross—and will return in glory.

**"Are you the Christ?"**

**"I am."**
