title: The Resurrection of Jesus
shortTitle: Resurrection
---
[Jesus](#jesus/jesus 'Parent')
---
"He is risen." The empty tomb. The appearances. The disciples transformed from hiding to proclaiming.

**The claim:** God raised Jesus bodily from the dead. Not resuscitation. Not spiritual survival. Resurrection—a transformed, glorified, physical body that will never die again.

**Greek questions:** What kind of body? How do we know it happened? Can we prove it historically? What's the mechanism of transformation?

**Hebrew testimony:** We saw Him. We touched Him. We ate with Him. Death is defeated. The Messiah is vindicated. The new creation has begun.

Is resurrection something to prove, or someone to encounter?

# The Resurrection: Death Defeated

**1 Corinthians 15:3-4:** "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures... he was buried... he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures."

**1 Corinthians 15:14:** "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain."

**The resurrection is the hinge of Christianity.** Without it, Jesus is just another failed messianic pretender. With it, everything changes.

## The Event: What Happened?

### The Crucifixion

**Friday (day one):** Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate (attested by Roman historians Tacitus, Josephus). He died around 3 PM.

**John 19:33-34:** Soldiers confirmed His death. Pierced His side—blood and water (medical detail suggesting death).

**Buried before Sabbath:** Joseph of Arimathea placed the body in a new tomb (Matthew 27:57-60). Women observed the location (Mark 15:47). Roman seal and guard posted (Matthew 27:65-66).

**Saturday (day two):** Sabbath. The disciples hid in fear. The tomb was sealed.

### Sunday Morning: The Discovery

**Sunday (day three):** Women came to the tomb at dawn.

**Mark 16:1-6:** The stone was rolled away. The tomb was empty. An angel: "He has risen; he is not here."

**All four Gospels agree:** The tomb was empty. The body was gone.

**Matthew 28:11-15:** Guards reported to chief priests. Priests bribed them to say "His disciples stole the body while we slept." This explanation was still circulating when Matthew wrote (decades later).

### The Appearances

**The risen Jesus appeared repeatedly over 40 days:**

**1. Mary Magdalene** (John 20:11-18) - "Do not cling to me"

**2. The other women** (Matthew 28:9-10) - Clasped His feet

**3. Peter** (Luke 24:34, 1 Corinthians 15:5)

**4. Two disciples on the Emmaus road** (Luke 24:13-32) - Walked with them, broke bread

**5. Ten disciples (Thomas absent)** (John 20:19-23) - Showed hands and side, ate fish

**6. Eleven disciples (Thomas present)** (John 20:24-29) - "Put your finger here; see my hands. Put your hand into my side."

**7. Seven disciples fishing** (John 21:1-14) - Breakfast by the sea

**8. More than 500 at once** (1 Corinthians 15:6) - Paul notes most are still alive (can verify)

**9. James (Jesus' brother)** (1 Corinthians 15:7) - Previously skeptical, later led Jerusalem church

**10. The Eleven on a mountain in Galilee** (Matthew 28:16-20) - Great Commission

**11. The disciples at the [ascension](#jesus/ascension 'Drill')** (Acts 1:3-11) - Witnessed Him taken up

**Pattern:** Physical (touched, ate), recognizable (known faces), yet transformed (appeared through locked doors, vanished, sometimes not immediately recognized).

## Greek Systematic Approach: Evidence and Explanation

Greek theology asks: **How do we know it happened? What kind of body? How does it work?**

### Historical Apologetics

**Can we prove the resurrection historically?**

#### 1. The Empty Tomb

**Facts widely accepted even by critical scholars:**
- Jesus was buried in a tomb (Joseph of Arimathea, member of Sanhedrin, unlikely to be invented)
- The tomb was found empty on Sunday
- The earliest Christian preaching proclaimed resurrection in Jerusalem (where the tomb could be checked)

**Alternative explanations:**

**Wrong tomb?** Women saw where He was buried (Mark 15:47). Joseph knew the location. Authorities could have produced the body if in the wrong tomb.

**Disciples stole the body?** They were hiding in fear. Roman guards at tomb. They later died for this claim—would they die for a known lie?

**Swoon theory (Jesus didn't really die)?** Roman crucifixion was effective. Spear thrust confirmed death. Even if He survived, a barely-alive Jesus couldn't inspire resurrection faith.

**Hallucination?** Too many witnesses, different times/places, group appearances (hallucinations are individual). Plus, hallucinations don't empty tombs.

**Legend (developed later)?** Paul's testimony is within 5 years of the event (1 Corinthians 15:3-8, received tradition). Gospels written within living memory. Too early for legend to displace reality.

#### 2. The Transformation of the Disciples

**Before resurrection:** Hiding in fear, Peter denied Jesus, scattered.

**After:** Boldly proclaiming resurrection in Jerusalem (hostile territory), willing to die for it, church exploded.

**Something happened** to cause this transformation. Mass delusion? Doesn't explain the empty tomb. Resurrection does.

#### 3. The Testimony of Women

**All four Gospels:** Women were first witnesses.

**Problem:** In first-century Judaism, women's testimony was not considered legally valid.

**If inventing a story to convince Jews:** Don't make women the first witnesses.

**Why include this detail?** Because that's what happened. Embarrassing historical details suggest authenticity.

#### 4. The Conversion of Skeptics

**James (Jesus' brother):** Skeptical during Jesus' ministry (John 7:5). After resurrection appearance (1 Corinthians 15:7), became leader of Jerusalem church, martyred for faith.

**Paul:** Persecuted Christians. Encountered risen Jesus on Damascus road (Acts 9, 1 Corinthians 15:8). Spent rest of life proclaiming resurrection, suffered for it, executed.

**What converts hostile skeptics?** Meeting the risen Jesus.

#### 5. The Origin of the Church

**Jewish context:** Crucifixion meant cursed by God (Deuteronomy 21:23). Messiah doesn't lose.

**Yet:** A group of Jews began worshiping a crucified man as [Lord](#jesus/lord 'Hebrew'), violating strict monotheism.

**What explains this radical break?** Resurrection vindication.

### The Nature of the Resurrection Body

**What kind of body did Jesus have?**

#### Physical Continuity

**Evidence of physicality:**
- **Empty tomb** (the same body that died)
- **Touchable:** Thomas touched wounds (John 20:27)
- **Ate food:** Fish (Luke 24:42-43), breakfast (John 21:9-13)
- **Flesh and bones:** Luke 24:39—"A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have"

**Not a ghost. Not a vision. Physical.**

#### Transformation

**Evidence of transformation:**
- **Appeared through locked doors** (John 20:19, 26)
- **Vanished** (Luke 24:31)
- **Not immediately recognized** (Mary thought He was the gardener, disciples on Emmaus road didn't recognize Him until He revealed Himself)
- **Ascended into heaven** (Acts 1:9)

**Not mere resuscitation** (like Lazarus, who died again). **Glorified, immortal body.**

#### Paul's Explanation: 1 Corinthians 15

**1 Corinthians 15:35-49:** Paul addresses the question "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body?"

**Analogy:** Seed and plant (v. 36-38)
- You sow a seed, it dies, a plant comes up
- Different form, but continuity
- The plant comes *from* the seed

**Different kinds of bodies:** (v. 39-41)
- Flesh of humans, animals, birds, fish—all different
- Earthly bodies, heavenly bodies—different glory
- God can make different kinds of bodies

**The resurrection body:** (v. 42-44)
- **Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption** (no decay)
- **Sown in dishonor, raised in glory**
- **Sown in weakness, raised in power**
- **Sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body**

**"Spiritual body" (σῶμα πνευματικόν):**
- Not "non-physical" (Greek: *pneuma* alone = spirit)
- But "body animated by Spirit" (vs. natural body animated by soul)
- Still physical (body = σῶμα), but transformed, incorruptible, immortal

**Adam and Christ:** (v. 45-49)
- First Adam: Living soul (natural)
- Last Adam (Christ): Life-giving spirit (spiritual)
- As we bore the image of the earthly (Adam), we will bear the image of the heavenly (Christ)

**Conclusion:** "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God" (v. 50). The physical body must be transformed into a glorified, immortal body fit for resurrection life.

### Theological Necessity

**Why did Jesus have to rise bodily?**

#### 1. Vindication of Jesus' Claims

**Romans 1:4:** Jesus was "declared to be the Son of God in power... by his resurrection from the dead."

If He stayed dead, He was a false [Messiah](#jesus/messiah 'Hebrew'). Resurrection proves God affirmed Him.

#### 2. Defeat of Death

**1 Corinthians 15:54-57:** "Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?... Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."

Death is the final enemy (1 Corinthians 15:26). If Jesus didn't conquer it, we're still enslaved.

#### 3. Atonement Completed

**Romans 4:25:** "Jesus... was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification."

The cross pays for sin. The resurrection declares the payment accepted. Both are necessary.

#### 4. Guarantee of Our Resurrection

**1 Corinthians 15:20-23:** "Christ has been raised from the dead, the **firstfruits** of those who have fallen asleep... in Christ shall all be made alive."

**Firstfruits:** The first of the harvest, guaranteeing more to come. His resurrection guarantees ours.

**Romans 8:11:** "If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you."

#### 5. Physical Creation Matters

**Gnostic view:** Spirit good, matter bad. Salvation = escape from the body.

**Christian view:** God created matter good. [Incarnation](#jesus/incarnation 'Drill') affirmed it. Resurrection redeems it.

**If Jesus didn't rise bodily:** Matter isn't redeemed. Final state is disembodied souls.

**But He did rise bodily:** The future is **resurrection**, not ghostly existence. **New heavens and new earth** (Revelation 21:1), not escape to a non-physical realm.

## Hebrew Narrative Approach: Testimony and Typology

Hebrew thought doesn't ask for philosophical mechanisms. It testifies to what happened and locates it in God's story.

### The Testimony: We Saw Him

**Acts 2:32 (Peter at Pentecost):** "This Jesus God raised up, and **of that we all are witnesses**."

**Acts 3:15:** "You killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. **To this we are witnesses.**"

**Acts 10:40-41:** "God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, not to all the people but to us **who had been chosen by God as witnesses**."

**1 John 1:1-3:** "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have **touched with our hands**... we proclaim also to you."

**Not:** Here's a philosophical proof.

**But:** Here's what we saw. We're witnesses. We touched Him. We ate with Him. He's alive.

### Old Testament Foreshadowing

The resurrection wasn't a random miracle. It's the climax of patterns woven through Scripture.

#### 1. Isaac (Genesis 22)

**Abraham commanded to sacrifice Isaac.** God provides a ram. Isaac is spared—"raised" from the altar of death.

**Hebrews 11:17-19:** "By faith Abraham... considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, **from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back**."

**Type:** Son given to death, given back (foreshadow of Christ).

#### 2. Jonah

**Matthew 12:39-40:** "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, **so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth**."

Jonah "died" (swallowed), then came back. Type of resurrection.

#### 3. The Third Day

**Hosea 6:2:** "After two days he will revive us; **on the third day he will raise us up**, that we may live before him."

Jewish expectation: God acts on the third day.

**Genesis 22:4:** On the third day, Abraham sees the place (Isaac spared).

**Exodus 19:16:** On the third day, God descends on Sinai.

**Jesus rose on the third day:** Fulfills the pattern.

#### 4. Resurrection Prophecies?

**Psalm 16:10:** "You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption."

**Acts 2:27-31 (Peter's interpretation):** This wasn't about David (his tomb is with us). It's about Christ, whom God raised.

**Psalm 22:** Suffering (v. 1-21), then deliverance and praise (v. 22-31). The psalmist doesn't stay dead.

**Isaiah 53:10-12:** The [Suffering Servant](#jesus/servant 'Hebrew') dies (v. 8-9), yet "he shall see his offspring... out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied" (v. 10-11). How, if dead? Resurrection implied.

### Resurrection as New Creation

**The resurrection isn't just Jesus coming back to life. It's the beginning of new creation.**

#### The Eighth Day

**Jesus rose on Sunday—the first day of the week.**

**Not coincidence:** Sunday is the **eighth day** (after the Sabbath, the seventh day).

**Significance:**
- **First creation:** Seven days (Genesis 1-2)
- **New creation:** Begins on the eighth day (resurrection)

**The resurrection is the start of the new world.**

#### Firstfruits

**1 Corinthians 15:20, 23:** Christ is the **firstfruits** of the resurrection.

**Leviticus 23:10-11:** Firstfruits offering—the first sheaf of barley harvest, waved before the LORD **on the day after the Sabbath** (Sunday).

**Jesus rose on the Feast of Firstfruits.** His resurrection is the beginning of the harvest—the resurrection of all the dead.

#### Last Adam

**1 Corinthians 15:45:** "The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a **life-giving spirit**."

**Adam:** Brought death into creation (Romans 5:12).

**Christ (last Adam):** Brings life, starts new creation.

**Romans 5:17:** "If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness **reign in life** through the one man Jesus Christ."

**Resurrection reverses the fall.**

#### New Heavens and New Earth

**Revelation 21:1-5:** "I saw a new heaven and a new earth... Behold, I am making all things new."

**Resurrection is the firstfruits of cosmic renewal.** Not just individual souls saved, but **creation restored**.

**Romans 8:19-23:** Creation itself groans, waiting for the resurrection of the dead ("the revealing of the sons of God"). When we're raised, creation is liberated.

**The resurrection is the hinge:** Old creation → New creation.

## The Centrality of Resurrection in Early Christianity

### Why Christianity Survived Jesus' Death

**Messianic movements in first-century Judaism:**

**Judas the Galilean (6 AD):** Led revolt, killed by Romans. Movement collapsed.

**Theudas (44 AD):** Claimed to be a prophet, beheaded. Followers scattered.

**Egyptian Prophet (50s AD):** Promised deliverance, Romans crushed him. Movement ended.

**Pattern:** Messiah dies → movement dies.

**Why didn't the Jesus movement collapse?**

**Because they believed He rose.** The resurrection turned defeat into victory.

### The Message: Christ Is Risen

**The earliest Christian preaching (kerygma) centered on resurrection:**

**Acts 2:24 (Peter):** "God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death."

**Acts 4:33:** "With great power the apostles were giving their testimony to **the resurrection of the Lord Jesus**."

**Acts 17:18 (Athens):** Paul preached "Jesus and the resurrection" (Greeks thought he was proclaiming two gods—Jesus and Anastasis [Resurrection]).

**Acts 17:31-32:** Paul on Mars Hill: God "will judge the world... by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by **raising him from the dead**." Result: Some mocked, some believed.

**Romans 10:9:** "If you confess with your mouth that **Jesus is Lord** and believe in your heart that **God raised him from the dead**, you will be saved."

**Resurrection is non-negotiable.** Remove it, Christianity collapses.

### Resurrection and Jewish Eschatology

**Jewish belief (Pharisees, not Sadducees):** The dead will be raised at the end of the age.

**Daniel 12:2:** "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."

**Martha (John 11:24):** "I know that he will rise again in the **resurrection on the last day**."

**Problem:** Jesus rose **in the middle of history**, not at the end.

**Christian explanation:** The end has broken into the present. Jesus' resurrection is the beginning of the general resurrection. We live in the **overlap of the ages**—the age to come has started, but the present age continues.

**"Already" and "not yet."**

## Objections and Tensions

### 1. Can Modern People Believe in Resurrection?

**Objection (Enlightenment-era skepticism):** Dead people don't rise. Miracles violate natural law. Resurrection is scientifically impossible.

**Response:**

**a. Natural law describes regularity, not exhaustive possibility.** Laws describe what *normally* happens, not what God *can't* do.

**b. Christianity doesn't claim resurrections are common.** Jesus' resurrection is unique—the **only** time God has raised someone to immortal, glorified life.

**c. If God exists and created the universe, raising the dead is trivial.** The question isn't "Can resurrections happen?" but "Does God exist, and did He raise Jesus?"

**d. The resurrection *is* a miracle.** Christianity doesn't deny that. The claim is: God intervened in history in a unique way. This is either true or false, but not impossible in principle.

### 2. What About Contradictions in the Accounts?

**Skeptical claim:** The Gospel accounts contradict each other (how many angels? who was at the tomb? what order of appearances?). This undermines credibility.

**Response:**

**a. Independent testimony naturally varies in detail.** If all four Gospels were identical, that would suggest collusion, not reliability.

**b. The core facts agree:** Empty tomb, women first witnesses, multiple appearances, disciples transformed.

**c. Minor discrepancies in secondary details don't negate major agreement on the event itself.**

**d. Eyewitnesses remember different details.** This is normal in testimony. Perfect harmonization would be suspicious.

### 3. How Can a Physical Body Be in Heaven?

**Objection:** Heaven is a spiritual realm. How can a physical body exist there?

**Responses:**

**a. Jesus' resurrection body is transformed—"spiritual body" (1 Corinthians 15:44).** Physical, but no longer subject to decay, gravity, or normal limitations.

**b. "Heaven" isn't just an immaterial realm.** The final hope is **new heavens and new earth** (Revelation 21:1)—a renewed physical creation where resurrected bodies fit perfectly.

**c. The [ascension](#jesus/ascension 'Drill') demonstrates the body can exist in God's presence.** Jesus' body didn't dematerialize—He entered God's dimension while remaining embodied.

### 4. If Jesus Rose, Why Don't We See Him Now?

**Objection:** If He's alive, why doesn't He appear to everyone?

**Responses:**

**a. He appeared to many over 40 days, then [ascended](#jesus/ascension 'Drill').** The appearances were for establishing the foundational witness of the apostles.

**b. Faith is based on testimony, not universal sight.** John 20:29—"Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

**c. He will appear again—the Second Coming.** Revelation 1:7—"Every eye will see him."

### 5. The Physical vs. Spiritual Tension

**Greek philosophy:** Valued the spiritual (eternal, unchanging) over the physical (temporal, decaying). Resurrection of the body seemed crude, unnecessary.

**Acts 17:32:** When Paul mentioned resurrection, Athenian philosophers mocked.

**Platonic hope:** Immortal soul escapes the body.

**Christian hope:** Immortal body (soul reunited with resurrected body).

**This is scandalous to Greek thought.** Why drag matter into eternity?

**Christian answer:** Because God created matter good, because the [Incarnation](#jesus/incarnation 'Drill') affirmed it, and because salvation is **restoration of creation**, not escape from it.

## Eilu V'Eilu: Holding the Tensions

Perhaps resurrection is both:
- **Historical event** (Greek: investigate, defend, prove)
- **Personal encounter** (Hebrew: testify, proclaim, witness)

Perhaps the resurrection body is both:
- **Physical continuity** (same body that died)
- **Transformed glory** (no longer bound by normal limitations)

Perhaps the evidence is both:
- **Sufficient** (enough to ground rational belief)
- **Not coercive** (room for doubt, requiring faith)

**Greek framework asks:** What kind of body? How does it work? Can we prove it?

**Hebrew framework testifies:** We saw Him. We touched Him. He's alive. Death is defeated.

**Both are needed.** Greek apologetics guards against dismissing resurrection as myth. Hebrew testimony prevents reducing it to abstract doctrine.

**Perhaps the resurrection is not primarily a puzzle to solve, but a reality to proclaim.**

**Perhaps the invitation isn't "Examine the evidence until all doubt is removed," but "Come and see. Encounter the risen Christ."**

**1 Peter 1:3:** "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a **living hope** through the **resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead**."

**Living hope.** Not abstract theology. A person—alive, victorious, coming again.

**He is risen.**

**He is risen indeed.**
