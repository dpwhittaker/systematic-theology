Does God know the future exhaustively, including all free choices humans will make? Or is the future genuinely open, unknown even to God until it happens?

"For those whom he foreknew he also predestined" (Romans 8:29). What is foreknowledge? Simple awareness of future events? Middle knowledge of all possible worlds? Or does God not know future free choices at all (open theism)?

The debate: If God knows what I'll choose tomorrow, can I choose otherwise? If I can't choose otherwise, am I free? If I can choose otherwise, how did God's knowledge count as knowledge (since it could be wrong)?

# Divine Foreknowledge: Does God Know the Future?

"Remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done" (Isaiah 46:9-10).

God declares the end from the beginning. He knows what will happen before it happens.

But how much does God know? Does He know every detail, including every free choice humans will make? Or is the future partially open, unknown even to God until it occurs?

**The question:** What is the relationship between God's knowledge and the future?

**Three main views:**

1. **Simple foreknowledge:** God knows all future events exhaustively, including all free choices. He knows because He observes the future (it's timelessly present to Him).

2. **Middle knowledge (Molinism):** God knows not only what will happen, but what would happen in every possible scenario. He uses this middle knowledge to sovereignly guide history while preserving human freedom.

3. **Open theism:** God knows all possibilities, but not which possibility free creatures will choose until they choose. The future is partially open, even to God.

**The implications are massive:** Prayer, providence, prophecy, [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew'), human freedom—all hinge on what God knows and when He knows it.

## Biblical Affirmations of God's Knowledge

### God Knows All Things

**1 John 3:20:** "God is greater than our heart, and he knows all things."

**Psalm 147:5:** "Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure."

**Job 37:16:** "Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?"

God's knowledge is perfect, complete, unlimited.

### God Knows the Future

**Isaiah 46:9-10:** "I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.'"

God declares what will happen before it happens. He knows the future.

**Isaiah 41:22-23:** "Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods; do good, or do harm, that we may be dismayed and terrified. Behold, you are nothing."

Knowing the future is a mark of deity. False gods can't do it. Yahweh can.

**Isaiah 42:9:** "Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them."

God announces future events before they occur.

**Prophecy assumes foreknowledge:** God predicts the fall of nations (Isaiah 13-23), the coming of Messiah (Isaiah 53), the return of Israel from exile (Jeremiah 29:10-14). These prophecies came true—God knew the future.

### God Knows Human Thoughts and Decisions

**Psalm 139:1-4:** "O LORD, you have searched me and known me! You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, you know it altogether."

God knows our thoughts before we think them, our words before we speak them.

**1 Chronicles 28:9:** "The LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought."

God knows every thought, every plan.

**Matthew 10:29-30:** "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered."

God knows the number of hairs on your head. Exhaustive knowledge of details.

## View 1: Simple Foreknowledge

### The Doctrine

**God knows all future events exhaustively, including all free choices humans will make.**

**How does He know?**

**God is eternal (outside time).** All moments are equally present to Him. He doesn't look into the future sequentially (as we do). He sees all of history—past, present, future—simultaneously.

**Analogy:** A man on a mountain sees the entire parade at once. People in the parade experience it sequentially. Similarly, God sees all of time at once. We experience it moment by moment.

**God's knowledge doesn't cause events.** He knows what will happen, but His knowledge doesn't make it happen. He observes the future as it is (from His eternal vantage point).

**Humans choose freely.** God knows what we'll choose, but He doesn't force our choice. We choose according to our desires. God knows what we'll desire and what we'll choose, but that knowledge doesn't remove our freedom.

### Biblical Support

**Psalm 139:16:** "Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them."

God knew David's days before any of them existed.

**Acts 2:23:** "This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men."

God foreknew the crucifixion. The lawless men chose freely (they're guilty). God knew it would happen.

**Acts 15:18:** "Known to God from of old are all his works" (NKJV). God has always known what He would do.

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."

Foreknowledge precedes [predestination](#freewill/predestination 'Greek'). God knew, then predestined.

**1 Peter 1:20:** "He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you."

Christ was foreknown before creation. God knew the plan of redemption before time began.

### Problems with Simple Foreknowledge

**1. How is foreknowledge useful if God doesn't control events?**

If God knows what will happen but doesn't ordain it, His knowledge is passive. He's a spectator, not a sovereign ruler.

**Calvinist critique:** Simple foreknowledge doesn't give God control. He knows, but can't guarantee outcomes. That undermines providence.

**If God foreknows that someone will reject the gospel, can He change it?** If yes, His foreknowledge was wrong (it wasn't really knowledge). If no, then the future is fixed—how is that different from determinism?

**2. Does foreknowledge eliminate freedom?**

**The argument:**
1. If God infallibly knows I'll choose A tomorrow, then it's impossible for me to choose B.
2. If it's impossible for me to choose B, I'm not free.
3. Therefore, foreknowledge eliminates freedom.

**Response (defenders of simple foreknowledge):**

God's knowledge doesn't *cause* my choice. He knows what I'll freely choose. His knowledge is *dependent on* my choice, not the reverse.

**Analogy:** If I watch you choose chocolate ice cream, my observation doesn't cause your choice. You chose freely. I just observed it. Similarly, God observes (from His eternal vantage point) what you'll choose. You still choose freely.

**Counter:** But if God's knowledge is infallible (He can't be wrong), then it's *necessary* that I choose A. If it's necessary, how am I free?

**Reply:** It's *hypothetically necessary* (given that God knows it, it must happen), not *absolutely necessary* (it must happen regardless of any conditions). You still choose freely; God's knowledge tracks your free choice.

**The debate continues.** This is one of philosophy's hardest problems.

## View 2: Middle Knowledge (Molinism)

### The Doctrine

**God has three kinds of knowledge:**

**1. Natural knowledge:** What God knows by His own nature. All possibilities, all logical truths, all things that could happen.

Example: God knows that *if* Peter is in situation X, Peter *could* deny Christ or *could* confess Him. Both are possible.

**2. Middle knowledge (*scientia media*):** What God knows about what free creatures *would* choose in every possible situation.

Example: God knows that *if* Peter is in situation X, Peter *would* freely choose to deny Christ three times. Not just that he could, but that he would.

This knowledge is "middle" because it's between natural knowledge (what could happen) and free knowledge (what will happen).

**3. Free knowledge:** What God knows will actually happen. Based on His decree (which possible world to actualize).

Example: God knows Peter *will* deny Christ, because God chose to actualize the world where Peter is in situation X.

### How Molinism Works

**Step 1:** God knows all possible worlds and what every free creature would choose in every situation (middle knowledge).

**Step 2:** God sovereignly chooses which world to create, knowing what free creatures will choose in that world.

**Step 3:** God actualizes that world. Free creatures make their choices freely. God's plan is accomplished.

**Example:** God knows that if He creates a world where Peter is tested at Jesus' trial, Peter will freely deny Christ. God creates that world. Peter freely denies (it's his choice). God's [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') is preserved (He chose the world). Peter's freedom is preserved (he chose to deny).

### Biblical Support

**1 Samuel 23:10-13:** David asks God, "Will Saul come down?" God says yes. David asks, "Will the men of Keilah surrender me?" God says yes. David leaves. Saul doesn't come. The men don't surrender.

**This is middle knowledge:** God knew what *would* happen if David stayed (counterfactual knowledge). Because God knew, David acted differently, and it didn't happen. But God's knowledge was still true (it's what would have happened).

**Matthew 11:21-23:** Jesus says, "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."

**Jesus knows what would have happened in a different scenario.** Tyre and Sidon would have repented if they'd seen the miracles. This is middle knowledge—knowing what free creatures would do in circumstances that don't actually occur.

### Strengths of Molinism

**1. Preserves both divine [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') and human freedom.**

God controls which world is actualized (sovereignty). Creatures choose freely within that world (freedom).

**2. Explains prayer and providence.**

God knows how free creatures will respond to circumstances, so He arranges circumstances to accomplish His purposes without violating freedom.

Example: God knows that if He sends Philip to the Ethiopian eunuch at time T, the eunuch will freely believe (Acts 8). God sends Philip. The eunuch believes freely. God's plan accomplished through free choice.

**3. Explains prophecy.**

God knows what people will freely choose, so He can predict the future accurately.

### Problems with Molinism

**1. Do counterfactuals of creaturely freedom have truth value?**

**The grounding objection (William Lane Craig's critics):**

For God to know what Peter *would* freely choose in situation X, there must be a *fact* about what Peter would choose. But if Peter hasn't been placed in situation X, how is there a fact? What grounds (makes true) the counterfactual?

**Molinist response:** God simply knows it by His perfect intellect. Counterfactuals are true, and God knows them, even if we can't explain how.

**Critic:** But if there's no grounding for the truth, it's arbitrary. How can God know something that has no basis in reality?

**2. Does this genuinely preserve freedom?**

If God chooses the world knowing what I'll choose, isn't He indirectly determining my choice?

**Example:** God knows that if I'm in situation X, I'll choose A. God creates the world where I'm in situation X. Therefore, God ensured I'd choose A (by controlling circumstances). How is that free?

**Molinist response:** God didn't force me to choose A. He just knew I would and arranged circumstances accordingly. I still chose freely.

**Critic:** But I couldn't have chosen otherwise (given that God actualized this world based on knowing I'd choose A). If I can't choose otherwise, I'm not free.

**3. Does God's knowledge depend on creatures?**

If God's middle knowledge is based on what creatures would freely choose, then God's knowledge is dependent on creatures. That seems to diminish God's sovereignty.

**Calvinist critique:** God's knowledge should be independent. He knows because He decrees, not because He observes what creatures would do.

## View 3: Open Theism

### The Doctrine

**God knows all possibilities, but not which possibility free creatures will choose until they choose.**

**The future is partially open.** God knows:
- All necessary truths (logic, mathematics).
- All past and present facts.
- All possibilities for the future.
- What He Himself will do.

**But God does not know future free choices** until they occur, because they don't yet exist to be known.

**This preserves genuine freedom.** If God doesn't know what you'll choose, your choice is genuinely open. You determine the future, not God's foreknowledge.

**God is still omniscient:** He knows all that can be known. But future free choices are not yet real, so they can't be known (even by God).

### Biblical Support (Open Theist Interpretation)

**Genesis 6:6:** "And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart."

**God regretted.** If He foreknew humanity would fall, why regret? Open theist: God didn't foreknow. He gave Adam genuine freedom, and Adam chose to rebel. God's grief is real.

**Genesis 22:12:** God says to Abraham, "Now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son."

**"Now I know."** Open theist: God didn't know until Abraham acted. He tested Abraham to find out.

**Jeremiah 19:5:** "They have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind."

**"Nor did it come into my mind."** Open theist: God didn't foresee this. It's genuinely surprising to Him.

**Jonah 3:10:** "When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil way, God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it."

**God relented.** Open theist: God's plan changed based on Nineveh's free response. He didn't foreknow they'd repent.

### Strengths of Open Theism

**1. Preserves genuine freedom.**

If the future is open even to God, then your choices are genuinely free. Nothing (not even God's foreknowledge) predetermines them.

**2. Makes sense of biblical language of divine regret, surprise, and change.**

Traditional views (simple foreknowledge, Calvinism) must explain these texts as anthropomorphisms (God speaking in human terms, not literal). Open theism takes them at face value.

**3. Makes prayer and relationship meaningful.**

If God doesn't know what you'll pray or choose, then your prayers and choices genuinely affect the future. God responds dynamically to a genuinely open relationship.

### Problems with Open Theism

**1. Denies exhaustive foreknowledge, which seems required by Scripture.**

**Isaiah 46:10:** "Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done."

God declares what will happen. Open theists must say this refers only to what God will do, not what creatures will do.

**Acts 2:23:** "Delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God."

God foreknew the crucifixion. But the crucifixion involved free choices by Judas, Pilate, the crowd. How did God foreknow if future free choices are unknowable?

**Open theist response:** God foreknew the crucifixion because He planned to accomplish it, regardless of how humans responded. He's resourceful enough to adapt His plan to achieve His purposes.

**2. Undermines prophecy.**

If God doesn't know future free choices, how can He predict them accurately?

**Example:** Jesus predicts Peter will deny Him three times before the rooster crows (Matthew 26:34). That's a very specific prediction involving Peter's free choices. How did Jesus know if the future was open?

**Open theist response:** God knows Peter's character so well that He can predict with high probability what Peter will do under pressure. Or, God sovereignly ensured this particular event (limiting Peter's freedom in this case).

**3. Makes God's promises uncertain.**

If God doesn't control or know the future, how can He guarantee promises like "I will build my church" (Matthew 16:18) or "Every knee shall bow" (Philippians 2:10)?

**Open theist response:** God is resourceful and powerful enough to ensure His ultimate purposes are fulfilled, even if He must adapt to changing circumstances.

**Critic:** This makes God more like a chess master (responding to moves) than a sovereign king (decreeing all things). It diminishes His majesty.

**4. It's a modern innovation, not historic Christian orthodoxy.**

No major church father, reformer, or creed taught open theism. It's a 20th-21st century development.

**Open theist response:** Truth isn't determined by tradition. Scripture should be our guide. And early Christians didn't face this question in the same philosophical terms.

## Foreknowledge and Predestination

**Romans 8:29-30:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son... And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified."

**What is the relationship between foreknowledge and predestination?**

### Arminian (Simple Foreknowledge) View

**Foreknowledge precedes predestination.**

God foreknew who would believe in Christ. Based on that foreknowledge, He predestined them to salvation.

**"Foreknew" = foresaw their faith.** God looked into the future, saw who would respond to the gospel, and predestined them.

**Predestination is conditional on foreseen faith.**

### Calvinist View

**Foreknowledge = election.**

"Foreknew" doesn't mean God simply observed future events. It means He set His love on them, chose them.

**Old Testament usage of "know":**
- Amos 3:2: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth" (known = chosen).
- Genesis 18:19: "For I have known him" (known = chosen for a purpose).

**Romans 8:29:** "Those whom he foreknew" = those whom He chose/loved.

**Foreknowledge is active, not passive.** God foreknew by choosing, not by observing.

**Predestination is unconditional** (not based on foreseen faith).

### Molinist View

**God foreknew (via middle knowledge) who would believe in various circumstances.**

He sovereignly chose to actualize a world where certain people would freely believe. He predestined those individuals based on His sovereign choice of which world to create.

**Both divine sovereignty and human freedom are preserved.**

## Practical Implications

### Prayer

**Simple foreknowledge:** God knows what you'll pray, but prayer still matters because He ordains both the means (prayer) and the end (the answer).

**Molinism:** God knows what you would pray in various circumstances. He arranges circumstances to accomplish His will through your prayers.

**Open theism:** God doesn't know what you'll pray. Your prayers genuinely affect the future. God responds dynamically.

### Prophecy

**Simple foreknowledge / Calvinism:** God knows or decrees the future, so prophecy is certain.

**Molinism:** God knows what people will freely choose, so He can predict accurately.

**Open theism:** Prophecy is either (1) God's announcement of what He will do, or (2) high-probability predictions based on God's deep knowledge of people and circumstances.

### Assurance

**Simple foreknowledge:** If God foreknew you'd believe, you're secure.

**Calvinism:** If God predestined you, you're eternally secure.

**Molinism:** God actualized a world where you believe. If genuine freedom includes ability to fall away, assurance may be conditional.

**Open theism:** Assurance is based on present relationship with God, not guaranteed future.

### Sovereignty

**Does foreknowledge enhance or diminish God's sovereignty?**

**Calvinist:** Sovereignty requires exhaustive control, not just knowledge. God must decree, not merely foresee.

**Molinist:** Sovereignty is demonstrated through God's choice of which possible world to actualize. He controls by arranging circumstances, knowing how creatures will respond.

**Open theist:** Sovereignty doesn't require control of every detail. God's sovereignty is shown in His ability to accomplish His purposes despite an open future.

## The Mystery

**Deuteronomy 29:29:** "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever."

**What's revealed:**
- God knows all things (1 John 3:20).
- God declares the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).
- We are [responsible](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew') for our choices (Ezekiel 18:20).
- We must choose (Joshua 24:15).

**What's secret:**
- Exactly how God's knowledge relates to the future.
- How divine foreknowledge and human freedom coexist.
- The mechanics of omniscience.

**Perhaps we can't fully comprehend how an eternal God relates to temporal creatures.** His ways are higher (Isaiah 55:8-9).

**Trust His knowledge, even when we can't explain it.**
