Can humans *choose*, or does God *decide* everything?

Key questions:
- *Predestination* - Did God choose who would be saved?
- *Election* - Unconditional or based on foreseen faith?
- *Free Will* - Can we truly choose God?
- *Responsibility* - If God controls all, are we accountable?
- *Compatibility* - Can sovereignty and choice coexist?

The Hebrew approach: God's will and human response both real.
The Greek approach: Logical consistency, either/or categories.
