Can humans *choose*, or does God *decide* everything? Christianity's most divisive question: [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') vs freedom, [predestination](#freewill/predestination 'Greek') vs human [responsibility](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew').

The tension: Does God's [foreknowledge](#freewill/foreknowledge 'Drill') determine the future, or does He know what we'll freely choose? Did He [elect](#freewill/election 'Greek') specific individuals before creation, or does He choose based on foreseen faith?

[Romans 9](#freewill/romans-nine 'Drill') declares God's absolute sovereignty. Romans 10 says "whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." How do we hold both?

Greek systematic theology: Calvinism vs Arminianism, compatibilism vs libertarian free will, determinism debates. Logical resolution through either/or categories.

Hebrew framework: Divine sovereignty and human choice held together without philosophical resolution. Not a [mystery](#freewill/mystery 'Hebrew') to solve, but a depth to reverence. "All is foreseen, yet freedom is given" (Mishnah Avot 3:15).

This section explores the fundamental sovereignty/freedom tension. For post-Fall human capacity, see [free will in anthropology](#man/free-will 'Drill'). For eternal security, see [perseverance](#salvation/perseverance 'Drill').
