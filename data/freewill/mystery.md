"The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever" (Deuteronomy 29:29).

Some truths are revealed: God is sovereign, we are [responsible](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew'). Some truths are secret: how they fit together.

Greek philosophy demands resolution. Hebrew wisdom holds the tension. *Eilu v'eilu*—these and these are the words of the living God.

# The Mystery: Holding Divine Sovereignty and Human Freedom

"Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?" (Romans 11:33-34).

After three chapters wrestling with God's [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') ([Romans 9](#freewill/romans-nine 'Drill')) and human [responsibility](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew') (Romans 10), Paul doesn't conclude with a systematic resolution. He concludes with worship.

**He doesn't solve the mystery. He bows before it.**

## What Is Mystery?

### Not Contradiction

**Mystery isn't logical contradiction** (A and not-A at the same time in the same way).

**Example of contradiction:** "God is one person and God is three persons." That's contradiction.

**Correct formulation:** "God is one in essence and three in persons." That's mystery (we can't fully comprehend it), but not contradiction (essence and person are different categories).

**Similarly with sovereignty and freedom:**

**Contradiction:** "God controls everything and controls nothing."

**Mystery:** "God controls all things, and humans genuinely choose."

**We can't fully explain how both are true, but Scripture affirms both.** That's mystery, not contradiction.

### Not Irrationality

**Mystery doesn't mean "throw out logic."**

**We use logic to understand what we can.** We define terms carefully. We examine Scripture. We reason from biblical premises.

**But we acknowledge limits:** Our logic is finite. God's ways are infinite (Isaiah 55:8-9).

**When Scripture affirms two truths that seem to tension with each other, we don't discard one to preserve logical neatness. We hold both, trusting that God's understanding is higher.**

**Romans 11:33-34:** "How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord?"

**Unsearchable.** **Inscrutable.** We can't fully grasp it. But we trust it's true.

### Not Excuse for Intellectual Laziness

**"It's a mystery" shouldn't be a cop-out to avoid hard thinking.**

**We should:**
- Study Scripture thoroughly.
- Define terms carefully.
- Examine arguments on all sides.
- Think as clearly as we can.

**But after rigorous study, we may still reach limits.** At that point, humility before mystery is appropriate.

**Don't appeal to mystery too quickly.** But don't dismiss it when you reach the boundaries of human comprehension.

## Hebrew Approach: Eilu V'Eilu

### "These and These Are the Words of the Living God"

**Talmud, Eruvin 13b:** A debate between the schools of Hillel and Shammai lasted three years. A heavenly voice declared: *"Eilu v'eilu divrei Elohim chayim"*—"These and these are the words of the living God."

**Both sides were right,** even though they contradicted each other on legal details.

**How can contradictory positions both be true?**

**The rabbis don't always mean logical truth.** They mean that both sides reveal depth, both have insight, both reflect authentic engagement with Torah.

**Sometimes truth is bigger than binary either/or.**

### Applied to Sovereignty and Freedom

**Calvinist emphasis:** God is sovereign. He [predestines](#freewill/predestination 'Greek'), [elects](#freewill/election 'Greek'), ordains all. Salvation depends entirely on His choice, not ours.

**Arminian emphasis:** Humans are responsible. We genuinely choose. God desires all to be saved. He respects our freedom to accept or reject Him.

**Eilu v'eilu:** These and these are the words of the living God.

**Both protect essential truths:**

**Calvinists protect:**
- God's absolute [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew').
- Salvation as entirely God's work (not dependent on us).
- The glory of God's electing grace.

**Arminians protect:**
- Human [responsibility](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew') and genuine choice.
- God's universal love (He desires all to be saved).
- The meaningfulness of God's invitations and commands.

**Can both be true?**

**Scripture affirms both without resolving the tension.** Perhaps the tension reveals depth we can't fully grasp.

**Perhaps trying to flatten the mystery into a system diminishes the truth.**

## The Biblical Pattern: Both/And

### God's Sovereignty and Human Responsibility in Scripture

**Scripture consistently affirms both without apology:**

**Genesis 50:20:** "As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good."

Joseph's brothers: genuinely chose evil. Guilty.
God: sovereignly meant it for good. Planned it.

Both are affirmed. No explanation of how both are true.

**Acts 2:23:** "This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men."

God's definite plan: Jesus' death was predetermined.
Lawless men: guilty of crucifying Him.

Both. No resolution.

**Acts 4:27-28:** "For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place."

Predestined by God's hand and plan.
Done by wicked men who are accountable.

Both.

**Philippians 2:12-13:** "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

You work (human responsibility).
God works in you (divine sovereignty).

Both are real. Paul doesn't explain how.

**Proverbs 16:9:** "The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps."

Man plans (genuine human decision).
The LORD establishes (divine sovereignty over outcome).

Both.

**Proverbs 19:21:** "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand."

Man plans. LORD's purpose prevails. Both are real.

### God Hardens, Man Hardens

**Exodus 4:21:** "But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go."

God hardens Pharaoh's heart (10 times in Exodus).

**Exodus 8:15:** "But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them."

Pharaoh hardens his own heart (10 times in Exodus).

**Both are stated as fact.** Scripture doesn't explain how both are true. It just affirms both.

**God is sovereign over Pharaoh's hardening.** Pharaoh is responsible for his hardness.

Both/and.

### God Chooses, We Choose

**Deuteronomy 7:6-8:** "The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession... because the LORD loves you."

God chose Israel. Sovereign [election](#freewill/election 'Greek').

**Joshua 24:15:** "Choose this day whom you will serve."

Humans must choose. Real decision.

**Both are commanded/affirmed.** God chooses. We choose. Both are true.

**Ephesians 1:4:** "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world."

God chose us before creation.

**Revelation 22:17:** "Let the one who desires take the water of life freely."

Genuine human choice. "Let the one who desires"—the invitation is real.

**Both are true.**

## The Secret and the Revealed

**Deuteronomy 29:29:** "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law."

**What is revealed:**
- God is sovereign. He rules all. Nothing escapes His control.
- We are responsible. We must obey. We're accountable for our choices.
- Both are true.

**What is secret:**
- How sovereignty and freedom fit together philosophically.
- Why God chooses some and not others.
- The mechanics of divine [foreknowledge](#freewill/foreknowledge 'Drill') and creaturely freedom.

**The revealed truths are enough for obedience.** We don't need to understand the secret things to trust and obey.

**God calls us to trust Him, not to comprehend everything.**

**Isaiah 55:8-9:** "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."

**God's ways are higher.** We won't fully grasp them. But we trust they're good.

**Job's response after God's speeches (Job 38-42):**

**Job 42:3:** "Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."

God didn't answer Job's "Why?" God revealed His majesty. Job bowed in worship.

**Sometimes the answer to "How can both be true?" is "Trust Me."**

## Greek vs. Hebrew Approaches to Mystery

### Greek Philosophy: Resolve or Reject

**Greek thought values logical coherence above all.**

**If two propositions seem to contradict, one must be false** (or redefined until they no longer contradict).

**Applied to sovereignty and freedom:**

**Option 1 (Determinism):** God controls everything. Human freedom is an illusion (or redefined as "acting according to your nature").

**Option 2 (Libertarianism):** Humans have genuine freedom. God's sovereignty is self-limited (or redefined as "achieving purposes without controlling details").

**Either/or.** Resolve the tension by choosing one side or redefining terms until they're compatible.

**Systematic theology often follows this Greek pattern:** Construct a logically coherent system. Everything must fit. Resolve all tensions.

### Hebrew Thought: Hold Both in Tension

**Hebrew thought is comfortable with paradox,** especially when it reveals the depth of God's character.

**Example: God's justice and mercy.**

**Justice demands punishment.** Sin cannot go unpunished.

**Mercy offers forgiveness.** God relents, shows compassion.

**How can God be both perfectly just and perfectly merciful?**

**Hebrew thought doesn't resolve it systematically.** Both are affirmed. The tension is held in worship.

**Exodus 34:6-7:** "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty."

**Forgiving iniquity.** **Will by no means clear the guilty.**

Both. No systematic explanation. Just the declaration of who God is.

**The cross resolves it practically (God's justice satisfied, mercy extended through Christ's substitution), but the mystery of how God holds both remains.**

**Similarly with sovereignty and freedom:** Both are declared. The tension is held. We trust without fully comprehending.

### Eilu V'Eilu in Practice

**When rabbis debated and reached impasse, sometimes the answer was:** Both views have merit. Both reflect truth. Hold both.

**This doesn't mean "truth is relative" or "contradictions are fine."** It means: Some truths are bigger than our categories. Don't flatten them to fit your system.

**Applied to Calvinism vs. Arminianism:**

**Don't dismiss either side as heresy** (unless they deny essential Christian doctrine—both Calvinism and Arminianism affirm the Apostles' Creed, the deity of Christ, salvation by grace, etc.).

**Don't say "It doesn't matter."** It does matter. Study carefully. Think rigorously. Have convictions.

**But hold your convictions with humility.** Recognize that the other side is protecting biblical truth you might underemphasize.

**Listen. Learn. Acknowledge the mystery.**

## Practical Wisdom: Live in the Tension

### Preach Both

**Don't sacrifice one truth for the other.**

**Preach sovereignty:** God chose you before the foundation of the world. Your salvation is secure. He will complete what He began (Philippians 1:6). Rest in His electing love.

**Preach responsibility:** You must believe. "Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved" (Romans 10:13). Repent and trust Christ. Don't presume you're elect apart from faith.

**Both are biblical. Both are necessary.**

**Charles Spurgeon (Calvinist):** "I believe the doctrine of election... and I hold the doctrine of man's responsibility with equal firmness. I never push one to the exclusion of the other."

**John Wesley (Arminian):** "I dare not exclude from heaven any whom God has not excluded... I believe God wills all men to be saved. Yet I believe He has chosen some to salvation. How these can both be true I do not pretend to explain."

**Both preach grace. Both preach urgency. Both preach the gospel.**

### Evangelize Everyone

**We don't know who the elect are.** So we preach to everyone.

**Matthew 28:19-20:** "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations."

**All nations.** The command is universal.

**Calvinist:** God ordains the means (preaching) as well as the end (salvation of the elect). Evangelize because God uses it to call His own.

**Arminian:** God offers salvation to all. Evangelize because people's eternal destiny depends on their response.

**Different frameworks, same urgency.**

### Pray Boldly

**If God is sovereign, does prayer matter?**

**Yes.** God ordains both the end and the means. Prayer is the means He uses.

**James 4:2:** "You do not have, because you do not ask."

**If humans are free, does God respond?**

**Yes.** God invites us to partner with Him through prayer. He responds to genuine relationship.

**Exodus 32:14:** "And the LORD relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people."

**Both views affirm prayer matters.** Pray with confidence.

### Trust God's Goodness

**When the mystery feels heavy:**

**Romans 9:14:** "Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!"

God is just. Always. Even when we don't understand.

**Genesis 18:25:** "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"

Yes. He will. Trust His character, even when you can't resolve the mystery.

**Psalm 97:2:** "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne."

His throne stands on righteousness and justice. Not arbitrary power. Not capricious cruelty. Justice.

**Trust Him.**

## The Doxological Resolution

**How does Paul resolve Romans 9-11?**

**He doesn't.** He worships.

**Romans 11:33-36:** "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen."

**The resolution isn't systematic. It's doxological.**

**We don't fully understand.** But we worship the God who is:
- Sovereign over all.
- Just in all His ways.
- Merciful beyond comprehension.
- Worthy of all glory.

**Perhaps the mystery is intentional.** It keeps us humble. It drives us to worship.

**If we could fully systematize God, we'd be tempted to think we've mastered Him.** The mystery reminds us: He's God, we're not.

**Job 11:7-9:** "Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? It is higher than heaven—what can you do? Deeper than Sheol—what can you know? Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea."

**We can't fully grasp God.** But we can know Him. We can trust Him. We can worship Him.

## The Final Word: Trust

**Deuteronomy 29:29:** "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever."

**What's revealed is enough.**

We know:
- God is sovereign.
- We are responsible.
- Salvation is by [grace](#salvation/grace 'Drill') through [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill') in Christ.
- God is good.
- His ways are just.
- He loves us.

**What's secret, we entrust to Him.**

We don't know:
- Exactly how sovereignty and freedom coexist.
- Why God chose some and not others.
- The full mechanics of divine providence.

**But we trust the God who does know.**

**Proverbs 3:5-6:** "Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."

**Don't lean on your own understanding.** It's limited. Trust Him. His understanding is perfect.

**The mystery stands.**

And in the mystery, we find not confusion, but worship.

*"Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!... To him be glory forever. Amen."* (Romans 11:33, 36).
