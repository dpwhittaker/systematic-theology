"He chose us in him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4). Before creation, God elected—chose, selected, set apart—a people for Himself.

But who did He choose, and why? Unconditional (based on nothing in us) or conditional (based on foreseen faith)? Individual (specific persons) or corporate (the Church as a body)?

Israel was chosen: "You are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession" (Deuteronomy 7:6). Not because Israel was great, but because God loved them.

The Church is chosen: "You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9). Chosen to be holy, to display God's glory.

# Election: God's Choosing

"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him" (Ephesians 1:3-4).

Election is God's act of choosing. Before time, before creation, before any human existed—God chose.

**The questions:**
- **Who** did God choose? Individuals or a corporate body (the Church)?
- **Why** did God choose? Based on nothing in us (unconditional) or based on foreseen faith (conditional)?
- **When** did God choose? Before creation (pretemporal) or in response to human decisions (temporal)?

**The stakes:** If election is unconditional and individual, God alone determines who is saved—human choice is irrelevant to salvation. If election is conditional or corporate, human choice plays a decisive role.

## Biblical Language of Election

### Hebrew: *Bachar* (בָּחַר)

**To choose, select, prefer.**

**Deuteronomy 7:6:** "For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen (*bachar*) you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth."

God chose Israel. Not because they deserved it, but because He loved them (Deuteronomy 7:7-8).

**1 Samuel 16:8-10:** God rejects Jesse's older sons. "The LORD has not chosen these." Then Samuel anoints David. God chose David, not based on appearance or strength, but on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).

**Isaiah 41:8-9:** "But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend; you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, 'You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off.'"

God chose Israel, called them, claimed them as His own.

### Greek: *Eklegomai* (ἐκλέγομαι)

**To choose, select, elect.**

**Ephesians 1:4:** "Even as he chose (*exelexato*, from *eklegomai*) us in him before the foundation of the world."

God chose us before creation.

**John 15:16:** "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit."

Jesus chose the disciples. They didn't choose Him first.

**1 Corinthians 1:27-28:** "But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are."

God's choice is surprising—He chooses the foolish, weak, despised. Not based on their merit.

### The "Elect" (*Eklektos*)

**Matthew 24:22:** "And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short."

The elect—those chosen by God.

**Romans 8:33:** "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies."

God's elect are justified, secure.

**Colossians 3:12:** "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience."

"Chosen ones"—the elect are to live in holiness.

**1 Peter 1:1:** "To those who are elect exiles."

Believers are elect.

## Old Testament Election: Israel as God's Chosen People

### Corporate Election

**God chose Israel as a nation, not individuals within Israel (initially).**

**Deuteronomy 7:6-8:** "The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession... It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers."

**Why did God choose Israel?**
- Not because they were numerous (they were few).
- Not because they were righteous (they were stubborn—Deuteronomy 9:6).
- Because He loved them and kept His oath to Abraham.

**Election is rooted in God's love and promise, not Israel's merit.**

**Amos 3:2:** "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."

God knew (chose, set His affection on) Israel alone. This brought privilege—and [responsibility](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew'). Election doesn't guarantee individual salvation (Israel was punished for sin), but it means corporate calling and identity.

### Individual Election Within Corporate Election

**Within Israel, God chose specific individuals for specific roles.**

**Abraham:** Called from Ur (Genesis 12:1). Not the most righteous man—he lied, doubted. But God chose him.

**Isaac over Ishmael:** "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named" (Genesis 21:12). God chose Isaac, not Ishmael.

**Jacob over Esau:** "The older will serve the younger" (Genesis 25:23). Before birth, before any actions, God chose Jacob.

**David:** Youngest son, overlooked by his family. God chose him to be king (1 Samuel 16).

**Jeremiah:** "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations" (Jeremiah 1:5).

**These are vocational elections** (chosen for a role), not necessarily salvific elections (chosen for eternal life). But they show God's pattern: choosing individuals sovereignly, not based on merit.

## New Testament Election: The Church as God's Chosen People

### Corporate Election: In Christ

**Ephesians 1:4:** "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world."

**"In him"—in Christ.** The elect are those who are in Christ. God chose the corporate body (Christ and His Church), not isolated individuals.

**Anyone who is united to Christ by faith is part of the elect.**

**Arminian interpretation:** God predestined the Church (corporately). Individuals enter the elect body by believing in Christ. Election is corporate; participation is individual and conditional (by faith).

**Analogy:** God elected Israel (corporately). Individuals participated in that election by being part of Israel. Similarly, God elected the Church. Individuals participate by being in Christ.

**1 Peter 2:9:** "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his possession."

Corporate language (race, priesthood, nation). The Church, as a body, is chosen.

### Individual Election: Chosen Before Birth

**Romans 9:11-13:** "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls—she was told, 'The older will serve the younger.' As it is written, 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.'"

God chose Jacob over Esau before birth, before any actions. For comprehensive analysis of both Calvinist (individual election to salvation) and Arminian (corporate/vocational election) interpretations, see [Jacob and Esau: Chosen Before Birth](#freewill/romans-nine#jacob-esau 'Drill').

**Acts 13:48:** "And as many as were appointed to eternal life believed."

**Appointment precedes belief.** Those appointed believed. Calvinist: Individual election. God appointed specific persons to eternal life, and they believed.

**Arminian response:** "Appointed" could refer to corporate appointment (those who aligned themselves with God's purposes) or to God's foreknowledge (He appointed those whom He foreknew would believe).

### Election to Salvation or Service?

**Is election primarily about salvation (who goes to heaven) or service (who has a role in God's plan)?**

**Old Testament election was primarily corporate and vocational:** Israel chosen to be a kingdom of priests, a light to the nations (Exodus 19:6, Isaiah 49:6). Individuals chosen for specific tasks (prophets, kings, priests).

**New Testament election language is often corporate:** The Church is chosen (1 Peter 2:9). Those "in Christ" are elect (Ephesians 1:4).

**But some texts seem individual and salvific:** Romans 8:29-30 (golden chain from foreknowledge to glorification), Romans 9:11-13 (Jacob chosen, Esau rejected before birth), John 6:37 (those the Father gives to the Son will come).

**Calvinist:** Election is primarily individual and salvific. God chose specific persons for eternal life.

**Arminian:** Election is primarily corporate. God chose the Church. Individuals enter by faith. Some texts speak of God's [foreknowledge](#freewill/foreknowledge 'Drill') (He elected those He foreknew would believe).

## Unconditional vs. Conditional Election

### Unconditional Election (Calvinist)

**God chose individuals for salvation based on nothing in them—not foreseen faith, not merit, not anything. Based solely on His sovereign will.**

**Ephesians 1:5:** "He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will."

**According to His will.** Not our faith or works.

**Romans 9:11:** "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls."

**Not because of works.** Not based on anything they did. Because of God's calling.

**2 Timothy 1:9:** "He saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and [grace](#salvation/grace 'Drill'), which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began."

**Before the ages began.** Not because of our works. God's purpose and grace alone.

**Why unconditional?**

**Because humans are totally depraved—spiritually dead, unable to choose God.**

**Ephesians 2:1:** "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins."

Dead people don't choose. God must choose them, regenerate them, give them [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill').

**John 6:44:** "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."

No one can come. We're unable. God must draw.

**If election were based on foreseen faith, it would be based on something we do.** That undermines grace. Salvation would depend (at least partly) on us.

**Romans 9:16:** "So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy."

Not our will. Not our exertion. God's mercy alone.

**Calvinist conclusion:** Election is unconditional. God chose whom to save, not based on anything in them. Pure sovereign grace.

### Conditional Election (Arminian)

**God chose to save those whom He foresaw would believe in Christ.**

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."

**Foreknowledge precedes predestination.** God foreknew, then predestined.

**What did God foreknow?**

**Calvinist:** He foreknew them (relational knowledge—He chose to know/love them). Foreknowledge = election.

**Arminian:** He foreknew their faith. He looked into the future, saw who would believe, and elected them based on that foreseen faith.

**1 Peter 1:1-2:** "To those who are elect exiles... according to the foreknowledge of God the Father."

**Election according to foreknowledge.** Arminian: God foresaw who would believe and elected them.

**Why conditional?**

**Because God genuinely desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) and offers salvation to all (John 3:16).**

If election were unconditional, God would choose some and pass over others, even though He desires all to be saved. That seems contradictory.

**Arminian solution:** God desires all to be saved. He offers [grace](#salvation/grace 'Drill') to all (prevenient grace). Those who respond in faith are elected based on that foreseen response.

**John 3:16:** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

**"Whoever believes."** The offer is universal. Anyone can believe.

**God's foreknowledge doesn't cause belief.** He simply foresees who will believe (enabled by prevenient grace) and elects them accordingly.

**Arminian conclusion:** Election is conditional on foreseen faith. God chose to save believers, not based on nothing, but based on His foreknowledge of their faith.

### The Debate: Does Foreknowledge Cause or Foresee?

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined."

**Calvinist:** Foreknowledge = God's relational choosing. "Foreknew" means He set His love on them, chose them. It's not neutral prediction; it's sovereign selection.

**Old Testament usage of "know":** Relational, covenantal.

**Amos 3:2:** "You only have I known of all the families of the earth."

"Known" = chosen, set affection on. Not: You're the only nation I have information about. But: You're the only nation I chose.

**Genesis 18:19:** "For I have known him (Abraham), that he may command his children... to keep the way of the LORD."

"Known" = chosen for a purpose.

**Similarly, "foreknew" in Romans 8:29 means God chose them before time.**

**Arminian:** Foreknowledge = God's awareness of future events. He knows all things, including future free choices. He foreknew who would believe and predestined them.

**This preserves human freedom.** God doesn't cause belief; He foresees it.

**Calvinist critique:** If election is based on foreseen faith, then the ultimate deciding factor is human choice, not God's grace. That makes salvation depend (at least partly) on us.

**Romans 9:16:** "So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy."

If God elects based on foreseen faith, it does depend on human will (the will to believe).

**Arminian response:** Faith is still a gift (enabled by grace). We're not earning salvation. We're responding to God's grace. God chose to save believers—that's His sovereign decision.

## Election and Assurance

### Calvinist: Assurance from God's Unconditional Choice

**If God chose you unconditionally, your salvation is secure.**

**Romans 8:33-34:** "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us."

**No charge can stand against the elect.** God chose them, Christ died for them, the Spirit intercedes for them. Secure.

**John 10:28-29:** "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out the Father's hand."

**The Father gave the elect to the Son.** No one can snatch them away. Secure in God's electing love.

**Assurance is based on God's choice, not ours.** If it depended on us, we could lose it. But it depends on God, who doesn't change (Malachi 3:6).

**2 Timothy 2:19:** "But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are his.'"

God knows His elect. That foundation is firm.

### Arminian: Assurance from Present Faith

**Assurance is based on present faith, not guaranteed future perseverance.**

**1 John 5:13:** "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."

**"Who believe"—present tense.** You can know you have eternal life *now* because you believe *now*.

**But if you stop believing, you can lose salvation.** Assurance is real but conditional on ongoing faith.

**Hebrews 3:14:** "For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end."

**"If indeed we hold."** Perseverance is required. Assurance isn't absolute—it depends on continued faith.

**Arminian strength:** Vigilance. Don't presume. Take warnings seriously.

**Arminian danger:** Anxiety. "Am I believing enough? Will I persevere?" Assurance becomes fragile.

## Election and Evangelism

### If God Has Already Chosen, Why Evangelize?

**Hyper-Calvinist problem:** If the elect will be saved no matter what, why preach the gospel? They'll be saved anyway.

**Biblical Calvinist response:** God ordains both the end (salvation of the elect) and the means (preaching the gospel).

**Romans 10:14:** "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?"

**Preaching is necessary.** God uses it to call the elect.

**Acts 18:9-10:** The Lord tells Paul, "Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent, for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people."

**God has His people in Corinth (elect). But Paul must preach for them to be saved.** Election and evangelism work together.

**We don't know who the elect are.** So we preach to everyone. God will use it to call His own.

**2 Timothy 2:10:** "Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."

Paul endures hardship for the elect. Evangelism is how the elect come to salvation.

### Arminian: Evangelism Is Essential Because Choice Is Real

**People's eternal destiny depends on their response to the gospel.**

**Romans 10:13:** "For 'everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'"

**"Everyone who calls."** The invitation is universal. We must preach so people can call.

**Mark 16:15:** "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all creation."

**To all creation.** Because salvation is offered to all.

**Urgency is clear:** Without the gospel, people won't believe. Without belief, they're lost. Evangelism matters.

## The Mystery: Both/And

### Scripture Affirms Both God's Choice and Human Choice

**God chose us:** Ephesians 1:4, John 15:16, Romans 9:11, 2 Timothy 1:9.

**We must believe:** John 3:16, Acts 16:31, Romans 10:9, Mark 1:15.

**Both are true.** Scripture doesn't resolve the tension philosophically. It holds both.

**Hebrew thought:** God elected Israel (corporate). Individuals responded (or didn't). Both God's choice and human response are real.

**New Testament:** God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. We must believe to be saved. Both are true.

**Deuteronomy 29:29:** "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever."

**What's revealed:**
- God chose us before creation.
- We must believe to be saved.
- Both are true.

**What's secret:**
- How unconditional election and genuine human choice coexist.
- Why God chose some and not others.

**We trust God's character, even when we can't resolve the [mystery](#freewill/mystery 'Hebrew').**

### Pastoral Wisdom: Preach Both

**Preach God's sovereign election:** Comfort for believers. You were chosen before the world began. Your salvation is secure in God's electing love.

**Preach human responsibility:** Urgency for unbelievers. You must believe. "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts" (Hebrews 3:15). The offer is real. Respond in faith.

**Don't sacrifice one for the other.** Both are biblical. Both are necessary.

**Charles Spurgeon (Calvinist):** "I have my own private opinion that there is no such thing as preaching Christ and Him crucified, unless we preach what nowadays is called Calvinism. It is a nickname to call it Calvinism; Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else."

**Yet Spurgeon also said:** "When you go home, if any of you stumble at the doctrine of election, do not stumble at God's Word, but stumble at my explanation of it. Come to the Word itself and learn what God has spoken."

**John Wesley (Arminian):** "I have no authority to exclude those from heaven whom God has not excluded. But I dare not shut out any penitent sinner from the gracious arms of the Saviour."

**Both preach the gospel fervently.** Both emphasize God's [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') and human [responsibility](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew'). Different frameworks, same urgency.

**Preach election for comfort. Preach responsibility for urgency. Trust God with the mystery.**
