[Free Will](#freewill/freewill 'Parent')

If God controls all, how can we be held accountable? If He [predestines](#freewill/predestination 'Greek') who will be saved, why punish the lost?

Paul anticipates the objection: "You will say to me then, 'Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?'" (Romans 9:19). His answer isn't philosophical—it's relational: "But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"

Scripture never diminishes human responsibility, even while affirming divine [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew'). We genuinely choose. We're accountable for our choices. Both are true.

# Human Responsibility: We Are Accountable

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil" (2 Corinthians 5:10).

We will be judged for our choices. God holds us accountable. We're responsible for what we do.

But if God is sovereign over all—if He [predestines](#freewill/predestination 'Greek'), decrees, ordains, hardens—how can we be responsible?

This is the objection Paul addresses in Romans 9:19: "You will say to me then, 'Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?'"

Paul's response: "But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?" (Romans 9:20).

Not a philosophical resolution. A relational rebuke. God's ways are higher. Accept both realities: God is sovereign, and you are responsible.

## Biblical Affirmations of Responsibility

### Commands Assume Responsibility

**If humans aren't responsible, why does God command?**

**Deuteronomy 30:19-20:** "I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live, loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him."

**"Choose."** God commands choice. He holds Israel accountable for their decision.

**Joshua 24:15:** "And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve... But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."

Joshua assumes Israel can choose. Their choice matters.

**Ezekiel 18:30-32:** "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin... For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; so turn, and live."

God judges "according to his ways"—individual accountability. He commands repentance. The command assumes we can (and should) turn.

### Judgment Assumes Responsibility

**If humans aren't responsible, why does God judge?**

**2 Corinthians 5:10:** "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil."

We're judged for what we've done. We're accountable for our actions.

**Matthew 12:36-37:** "I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."

Every word accountable. We'll give an account.

**Revelation 20:12-13:** "And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done... And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done."

Judgment according to deeds. Individual responsibility.

### Warnings Assume Responsibility

**Hebrews 2:1-3:** "Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away. For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?"

**"We must."** "How shall we escape if we neglect?"

Warnings presume we can heed or neglect. We're responsible to respond.

**Hebrews 3:12:** "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God."

Warning to believers: Don't fall away. You're responsible to persevere.

**Matthew 25:41-46:** The sheep and goats judgment. "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire... for I was hungry and you gave me no food."

Judgment for failing to act. Responsibility for what we didn't do.

## The Tension: Sovereignty and Responsibility

### The Problem

**If God ordains all things (Ephesians 1:11), how can we be held responsible for what God ordained?**

**Examples that create the tension:**

**1. Pharaoh's hardened heart**

Exodus 4:21: "I will harden his heart."
Exodus 7:13: "Pharaoh's heart was hardened."
Exodus 8:15: "He hardened his heart."

**God hardens. Pharaoh hardens himself. God judges Pharaoh for his hardness.**

How is Pharaoh responsible if God hardened him?

**2. The crucifixion**

Acts 4:27-28: "For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place."

**God predestined the crucifixion. Wicked men carried it out. They're judged for their sin.**

How are they responsible if it was predestined?

**3. Romans 9**

Romans 9:18: "So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills."

Romans 9:19: "You will say to me then, 'Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?'"

**Paul anticipates the objection.** If God hardens whom He wills, how can He blame them? They're just doing what He willed.

**Paul's answer (Romans 9:20-21):** "But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, 'Why have you made me like this?' Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?"

**Not a philosophical answer. A relational one:** God is Creator. You are creature. He has the right. You don't get to question Him.

**This is unsatisfying to Greek philosophical minds** (which demand logical resolution). But it's consistent with Hebrew covenantal thought: God's ways are higher (Isaiah 55:8-9). Trust Him.

## Greek Systematic Approaches

### Calvinist: Compatibilism

**Humans are responsible because they act according to their desires.**

**You're free if:**
- You do what you want (voluntarily).
- No external force coerces you.

**You're responsible if:**
- You act according to your desires.
- Your choice reflects your character.

**God doesn't coerce.** He changes the heart so we freely (willingly) choose what He ordained.

**Analogy:** A man falls from a cliff. He's responsible for jumping (he chose to). But gravity (which he didn't create) ensures he falls. Similarly, we choose according to our nature (which God creates).

**Jonathan Edwards:** "The will always chooses according to the strongest inclination." We're responsible for our choices because they reflect our inclinations. God is sovereign over our inclinations.

**Philippians 2:13:** "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

God works in us to will. We will. Both are real. We're responsible for what we will, even though God produced the willing.

**Critique:** If God determines my desires, and my desires determine my choices, how am I genuinely responsible? Isn't this just sophisticated determinism with responsibility grafted on?

**Response:** Responsibility doesn't require absolute autonomy (libertarian free will). It requires that you act according to your character and desires. You're responsible for who you are, even if God made you that way.

### Arminian: Libertarian Free Will

**Humans are responsible because they genuinely could have chosen otherwise.**

**Libertarian free will:** A choice is free (and thus morally responsible) only if:
- You could have chosen differently.
- Nothing (including God) determined your choice.

**God gives [grace](#salvation/grace 'Drill') to all (prevenient grace), enabling them to choose.** But He doesn't determine the choice. The choice is genuinely ours.

**This preserves responsibility:** You're accountable because you really could have chosen God, but you didn't.

**John 3:16:** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

**"Whoever believes."** The offer is universal. The choice is ours.

**Matthew 23:37:** "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem... How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!"

Jesus wanted to gather them. They refused. They were responsible for refusing.

**Critique:** If the ultimate deciding factor is human choice, doesn't salvation depend on us? And if God knows what we'll choose but doesn't intervene, isn't He still responsible for our damnation?

**Response:** God gives grace and invites. We're responsible to respond. God isn't obligated to override our will. He respects our freedom, even when we choose wrongly.

### Molinism: Middle Ground

**God knows what free creatures would choose in every possible situation (middle knowledge).**

**Using that knowledge, God sovereignly arranges circumstances**, knowing what we'll freely choose.

**Example:** God knows that if Peter is in situation X at time T, Peter will freely deny Christ three times. God ordains situation X. Peter freely denies. God's sovereignty preserved (He chose the circumstances). Peter's responsibility preserved (he genuinely chose).

**Both sovereignty and responsibility maintained.**

**Critique:** Does this genuinely preserve freedom? If God chose the world knowing what I'd choose, isn't He determining my choice indirectly?

**Response (Molinist):** No. You're still choosing freely. God didn't force your choice—He just knew what you'd choose and arranged circumstances accordingly.

**Critique (Calvinist):** This makes God's knowledge dependent on what creatures would do. It limits God's sovereignty.

**Critique (Arminian):** This is still determinism with extra steps. If God controls circumstances knowing what I'll choose, He's effectively determining my choice.

## Hebrew Framework: Mystery, Not Resolution

### Both Affirmed Without Philosophical Reconciliation

**Hebrew Scripture holds divine [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') and human responsibility together without resolving the tension.**

**Exodus:** God hardens Pharaoh. Pharaoh hardens himself. God judges Pharaoh.

**No explanation given.** Both are stated as fact.

**Isaiah 10:5-7, 12-13:** God sends Assyria as the rod of His anger. Assyria intends conquest for its own glory (not God's purposes). God will punish Assyria for its pride.

**How can Assyria be punished if God sent them?**

No answer. Both are affirmed.

**Acts 2:23:** "This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men."

God's plan. Lawless men's guilt. Both real.

### The Rabbinic Paradox

**Mishnah, Avot 3:15:** "All is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given."

Rabbi Akiva doesn't resolve the paradox. He states both: God foresees all. We choose freely.

**Talmud, Berachot 33b:** "Everything is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven."

God controls all. Except our response to Him—that's genuinely ours.

**Not logical resolution. Relational tension.**

### Eilu V'Eilu: These and These

**Eilu v'eilu divrei Elohim chayim:** "These and these are the words of the living God."

When rabbis disagree, sometimes both are affirmed as truth. The tension reveals depth, not contradiction.

**Regarding responsibility:**

**God is sovereign.** He ordains all. Nothing escapes His control.

**We are responsible.** We genuinely choose. We're accountable.

**Both are the words of the living God.**

The [mystery](#freewill/mystery 'Hebrew') isn't solved. It's held in reverence.

## Practical Implications

### 1. We Pray and Act

**If God is sovereign, why pray?**

**Because God ordains the means (prayer) as well as the end (the answer).** Prayer isn't pointless—it's the means God uses.

**James 4:2:** "You do not have, because you do not ask."

**If God is sovereign, why evangelize?**

**Because God ordains the means (preaching) as well as the end (salvation).** Evangelism isn't pointless—it's the instrument God uses.

**Romans 10:14:** "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?"

**We act because we're responsible.** Our choices matter. God uses them.

### 2. We Trust God's Justice

**Romans 9:14:** "What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!"

If God is sovereign over who is saved and who is lost, is He unjust?

**Paul's answer:** "By no means!" God is just. His ways are higher. Trust Him.

**We don't understand how sovereignty and responsibility fit together.** But we know God is good. We trust His character even when we can't resolve the [mystery](#freewill/mystery 'Hebrew').

**Genesis 18:25:** "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"

Abraham appeals to God's justice. We do the same. God will do right, even if we don't understand how.

### 3. We Hold Both in Humility

**The danger of emphasizing sovereignty alone:** Fatalism. "God controls everything, so nothing I do matters." Passivity. Presumption.

**The danger of emphasizing responsibility alone:** Anxiety. "Everything depends on me." Pride (if we succeed). Despair (if we fail).

**The biblical balance:** God is sovereign (He controls all). I am responsible (my choices matter). Both are true.

**Philippians 2:12-13:** "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

**Work** (responsibility). **God works in you** (sovereignty). Both.

## The Unanswered Question

**Romans 9:19-20:** "You will say to me then, 'Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?' But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"

Paul doesn't answer the question philosophically. He rebukes it relationally.

**The question assumes we have the right to demand an explanation from God.** We don't.

**Deuteronomy 29:29:** "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever."

**What's revealed:**
- God is sovereign.
- We are responsible.
- Both are true.

**What's secret:**
- How they fit together.
- Why God hardens some and not others.
- The philosophical mechanics of divine sovereignty and human freedom.

**We trust God's character, not our comprehension.**

**Isaiah 55:8-9:** "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."

God's ways are higher. We won't fully understand. But we trust Him.

**Job 38-41:** God's answer to Job isn't an explanation of suffering. It's a revelation of His majesty and wisdom. "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" (Job 38:4).

**Job's response (Job 42:3):** "Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."

**Sometimes the answer to "Why?" is "Trust Me."**

And sometimes the answer to "How can both be true?" is "They are. Trust that I am good."

We're responsible. We'll be judged. Our choices matter.

And God is sovereign. He works all things according to His will. Nothing escapes His governance.

Both are true. The tension stands.
