[Free Will](#freewill/freewill 'Parent')
---
Before the foundation of the world, did God decree who would be saved and who would be lost? Or does He save those whom He foreknows will believe?

"He chose us in him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4). "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined" (Romans 8:29).

The decree: fixed, eternal, unchangeable. "Many are called, but few are chosen" (Matthew 22:14).

The question divides: Unconditional [election](#freewill/election 'Greek') (God chooses regardless of foreseen faith) or conditional (God chooses based on foreseen faith)?

# Predestination: The Eternal Decree

"Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will" (Ephesians 1:4-5).

Before creation, God chose. Before time began, the decision was made. Some predestined for salvation, others passed over.

This is predestination—God's eternal decree determining the destiny of souls.

**The question:** Is predestination unconditional (God chooses whom to save regardless of any foreseen faith or merit) or conditional (God chooses to save those whom He foresees will believe)?

**The stakes:** If unconditional, God alone determines who is saved—human choice is irrelevant. If conditional, human choice plays a decisive role—God responds to what He foresees.

## Biblical Foundations

### Unconditional Predestination Texts

**Ephesians 1:4-5:** "Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world... In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will."

**When?** Before the world existed.
**Based on what?** "The purpose of his will"—not our merit or foreseen faith.

**Romans 8:29-30:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son... And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified."

**The golden chain:** Foreknowledge → predestination → calling → justification → glorification. Unbroken. If you're predestined, you will be glorified.

**Romans 9:11-13:** "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of [election](#freewill/election 'Greek') might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls—she was told, 'The older will serve the younger.' As it is written, 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.'"

**Before birth.** Before any action, good or bad. God chose Jacob over Esau. Not based on foreseen faith or works. Based on His purpose.

**2 Timothy 1:9:** "He saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began."

**Before the ages began.** God's purpose and grace given to us in eternity past. Not because of our works.

**Acts 13:48:** "And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed."

**Appointment precedes belief.** Those appointed to eternal life believed. Not: those who believed were appointed. Cause and effect: appointment → belief.

**John 6:37:** "All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out."

**The Father gives people to the Son.** Those given will come. Not: those who come are given. The giving precedes the coming.

**John 15:16:** "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit."

Jesus chose the disciples. They didn't choose Him first.

### Conditional Predestination Texts

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."

**Foreknowledge precedes predestination.** God foreknew, then predestined based on what He foreknew.

**What did He foreknow?** Calvinist: He foreknew them (relational knowledge, choosing). Arminian: He foreknew their faith (foreseen response).

**1 Peter 1:1-2:** "To those who are elect exiles... according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ."

**Election according to foreknowledge.** Arminian: God foresaw who would believe and elected them based on that foresight.

**John 3:16:** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."

**"Whoever believes."** Universal offer. Arminian: God predestined those whom He foresaw would believe.

**1 Timothy 2:3-4:** "This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."

**God desires all to be saved.** If God predestined only some unconditionally, how does He desire all to be saved?

**2 Peter 3:9:** "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."

**Not wishing any to perish.** Arminian: God's will is for all to be saved. But He allows human choice. Predestination is based on foreseen faith.

## The Calvinist View: Unconditional Predestination

### The Doctrine

**God, before creation, unconditionally chose (elected) some individuals for salvation and passed over others, leaving them in their sin.**

**Unconditional:** Not based on foreseen faith, works, or any merit in the individual. Based solely on God's sovereign will.

**Romans 9:16:** "So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy."

Not our will. Not our effort. God's mercy alone.

**Ephesians 2:8:** "For by [grace](#salvation/grace 'Drill') you have been saved through [faith](#salvation/faith 'Drill'). And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God."

Faith itself is a gift. We don't generate it. God gives it to the elect.

### Why Unconditional?

**Because humans are totally depraved (dead in sin, unable to choose God).**

**Ephesians 2:1:** "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins."

Dead people don't choose. God must make them alive first (regeneration), then they believe.

**John 6:44:** "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."

No one can come. We're unable. The Father must draw.

**If election were based on foreseen faith, it would be based on something we do** (even if enabled by grace). That makes salvation partly dependent on us.

**But Romans 9:11** says the choice was made "not because of works but because of him who calls."

If God looked into the future and saw who would believe, and elected them based on that, the choice would be "because of works" (the work of believing). But Paul says it's not because of works.

**Therefore, election is unconditional.**

### The Westminster Confession (1646)

**Chapter 3.3:** "By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death."

**3.5:** "Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his will, hath chosen in Christ, unto everlasting glory, out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto."

**Unconditional:** No foresight of faith or works as conditions.

**Sovereign:** God's will alone determines who is saved.

### Double Predestination

**If God predestines some to salvation, what about the rest?**

**Two forms of double predestination:**

**1. Equal ultimacy (Hyper-Calvinism):** God actively predestines some to salvation and actively predestines others to damnation.

God creates some vessels for wrath, actively hardening and damning them, just as He creates vessels for mercy.

**Most Calvinists reject this.** It makes God the author of sin.

**2. Asymmetrical predestination (Mainstream Calvinism):** God actively chooses some for salvation (election). God passes over the rest, leaving them in their sin (reprobation).

**Election is active:** God intervenes, regenerates, saves.

**Reprobation is passive:** God doesn't intervene. He leaves them to the condemnation they deserve.

**Romans 9:22-23:** "What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory?"

**"Prepared for destruction"** (passive voice—they prepared themselves by sin).

**"Prepared beforehand for glory"** (active—God prepared them).

**Asymmetry:** God actively saves. He passively condemns by withholding grace they don't deserve.

### Infralapsarianism vs. Supralapsarianism

**The logical order of God's decrees:**

**Infralapsarianism (Most Common):**
1. God decrees to create.
2. God decrees to permit the Fall.
3. God decrees to elect some fallen sinners to salvation and pass over others.
4. God decrees to provide redemption for the elect.
5. God decrees to apply redemption to the elect.

**In this view, predestination considers humans as fallen.** God elects some sinners to save; He doesn't create people for damnation.

**Supralapsarianism (Minority View):**
1. God decrees to elect some to salvation and reprobate others to damnation.
2. God decrees to create those individuals.
3. God decrees to permit the Fall.
4. God decrees to provide redemption for the elect.
5. God decrees to apply redemption to the elect.

**In this view, predestination precedes the Fall.** God decrees election/reprobation before (logically) decreeing creation or Fall.

**Critique:** This makes God the author of sin. He creates people for damnation.

**Most Calvinists are infralapsarian:** God elects from among fallen sinners, not before the Fall.

### Objections to Unconditional Predestination

**1. It makes God unjust.**

If God chooses some and not others, and the choice isn't based on anything they do, how is that fair?

**Calvinist response (Romans 9:14-15):** "What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.'"

God has the right to show mercy to some and not to others. No one deserves mercy. If God saves anyone, it's grace. If He doesn't save everyone, He's not unjust—He's giving them what they deserve (condemnation).

**2. It makes evangelism pointless.**

If God has already decided who will be saved, why evangelize?

**Calvinist response:** God ordains the means (preaching) as well as the end (salvation). We evangelize because God commands it and uses it.

**Romans 10:14:** "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?"

Preaching is necessary. God uses it to call the elect.

**3. It makes God the author of sin.**

If God predestines some to damnation (even passively), isn't He responsible for their sin?

**Calvinist response:** God doesn't cause sin. He permits it. He withholds grace (which no one deserves). The reprobate sin freely (according to their desires). They're [responsible](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew') for their sin, not God.

**Westminster Confession 3.1:** "God from all eternity did... freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet so as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures."

God ordains all. But He's not the author of sin, and creatures act freely.

**How both are true is a [mystery](#freewill/mystery 'Hebrew').**

**4. It contradicts God's desire for all to be saved.**

**1 Timothy 2:4:** God "desires all people to be saved."

If God desires all to be saved and predestines only some, isn't there a contradiction?

**Calvinist response:** God's will has two aspects:

**Decretive will (what God ordains):** He predestines some to salvation.

**Preceptive will (what God commands/desires):** He desires all to repent and be saved.

**Analogy:** A parent desires their child to willingly obey. But if the child rebels, the parent may decree discipline (not the parent's desire, but necessary given the child's choice).

Similarly, God desires all to be saved (preceptive will), but He decrees to save only the elect (decretive will).

**Ezekiel 33:11:** "Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live."

God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He desires their repentance. But He doesn't force it.

## The Arminian View: Conditional Predestination

### The Doctrine

**God, before creation, foresaw who would believe in Christ and predestined those individuals to salvation.**

**Conditional:** Based on foreseen faith. God looked into the future, saw who would believe, and elected them based on that foresight.

**Romans 8:29:** "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined."

Foreknowledge precedes predestination. God foreknew who would believe, then predestined them.

**1 Peter 1:2:** "Elect... according to the foreknowledge of God the Father."

Election is according to foreknowledge. God foreknew their faith and elected them based on it.

### Why Conditional?

**Because God genuinely desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) and offers salvation to all (John 3:16).**

If God unconditionally predestined only some, how can He genuinely desire all to be saved?

**Arminian answer:** God desires all to be saved. He offers grace to all. Those who respond in faith are predestined/elected based on that foreseen faith.

**John 3:16:** "Whoever believes..." The offer is universal. Anyone can believe.

**God's [foreknowledge](#freewill/foreknowledge 'Drill') doesn't cause belief.** He simply foresees who will believe and elects them accordingly.

**Analogy:** A teacher foresees which students will study hard and pass the exam. The teacher doesn't cause their studying—the teacher just knows who will pass. Similarly, God foresees who will believe and elects them.

### Corporate Election

**Some Arminians emphasize corporate (not individual) election.**

**Ephesians 1:4:** "He chose us in him."

**In Christ.** The elect are those who are in Christ. God predestined the corporate body (the Church), not specific individuals.

**Anyone who believes is incorporated into the elect body (Christ).** Election is corporate. Individuals enter it by faith.

**Analogy:** God elected Israel as His people (corporate). Individuals participated in that election by being part of Israel. Similarly, God elected the Church (corporate). Individuals participate by being in Christ.

### Objections to Conditional Predestination

**1. It makes salvation depend on human choice.**

If God elects based on foreseen faith, then ultimately salvation depends on our choice to believe, not God's choice to save.

**Calvinist critique:** This undermines grace. If the deciding factor is our faith, then we have something to boast in (we believed, they didn't).

**Arminian response:** Faith is still a gift (enabled by grace). We're not boasting in ourselves—we're responding to God's grace. But God respects our freedom to accept or reject.

**2. It makes God's foreknowledge the basis of election (not His will).**

**Calvinist critique:** Romans 9:11 says election is "not because of works but because of him who calls." If God elects based on foreseen faith, it's because of works (the work of believing).

**Arminian response:** Faith isn't a work. It's receiving a gift. And God's will is to save all who believe—that's still God's sovereign choice.

**3. It doesn't solve the problem of why some believe and others don't.**

If prevenient grace is given to all, enabling all to believe, why do some believe and others don't?

**Calvinist critique:** If grace is the same for all, the deciding factor is human will. That makes humans, not God, the ultimate cause of salvation.

**Arminian response:** The mystery of human freedom. God enables all, but respects our choice. Why some choose and others don't is inscrutable—but it's not because God withheld grace.

## The Mystery: Can Both Be True?

### Biblical Texts Affirm Both

**God chooses us:** Ephesians 1:4, Romans 9:11-13, John 15:16, 2 Timothy 1:9.

**We choose God:** Joshua 24:15, Deuteronomy 30:19, John 3:16, Revelation 22:17.

**God's choice is unconditional:** Romans 9:11 ("not because of works"), Ephesians 2:8 ("this is not your own doing").

**God desires all to be saved:** 1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:9, Ezekiel 33:11.

**How do we reconcile these?**

**Calvinist:** God's desire for all to be saved is His preceptive will (what He commands). His decree to save only the elect is His decretive will (what He ordains). Both are real.

**Arminian:** God desires all to be saved and offers grace to all. But He respects human freedom. Election is based on foreseen faith.

**Hebrew framework:** Perhaps the tension isn't meant to be resolved. God's [sovereignty](#freewill/sovereignty 'Hebrew') and human [responsibility](#freewill/responsibility 'Hebrew') are both real. Predestination and genuine choice are both affirmed.

**Deuteronomy 29:29:** "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us."

**What's revealed:** God chose us before the foundation of the world. We must believe to be saved. Both are true.

**What's secret:** How they fit together. The mechanics of divine sovereignty and human freedom.

We trust God's character, even when we can't resolve the mystery.

### Pastoral Application

**Comfort:** If you believe in Christ, you were chosen before the foundation of the world. God's choice is sure. You're secure in His electing love.

**Urgency:** The gospel call is real. "Whoever believes in him should not perish" (John 3:16). Respond in faith. Don't presume you're elect apart from believing.

**Humility:** We don't know who the elect are. Evangelize everyone. God uses the preaching of the gospel to call His people.

**Worship:** "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!" (Romans 11:33).

Predestination is ultimately about God's glory. He chose us to the praise of His glorious grace (Ephesians 1:6).
