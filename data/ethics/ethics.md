How should Christians live?

**Greek approach:** Categorical imperatives, natural law, virtue ethics—universal principles derived from reason and revelation.

**Hebrew approach:** Covenant faithfulness, *imitatio Dei* (imitating God), walking in His ways—relational obedience, not abstract principles.

One asks: What is the right thing to do? The other asks: How do I walk faithfully with God?

# Christian Ethics: Living the Faith

Theology asks what we believe. Ethics asks how we live. The two are inseparable—doctrine shapes practice, practice reveals belief.

## What Is Christian Ethics?

Christian ethics is the study of how believers should conduct their lives in light of God's revelation. It applies theology to daily decisions, relationships, and social structures.

**Key questions:**
- What makes an action right or wrong?
- How do we know God's will?
- How should Christians engage culture, politics, work?
- What principles guide specific issues (sexuality, money, justice)?

## Greek Approach: Universal Principles

Western ethical thinking (shaped by Greek philosophy) emphasizes:

### Natural Law

**The concept:** Moral truths are embedded in creation, accessible to reason. All humans can discern basic right and wrong through conscience and observation of natural order.

**Romans 2:14-15:** "Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires... They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts."

**Proponents:** Aristotle (virtue ethics), Aquinas (synthesized Aristotle with Christianity), Catholic moral teaching.

**Strengths:**
- Provides common ground for dialogue with non-Christians
- Explains why all cultures have *some* moral knowledge
- Grounds objective morality in creation, not just commands

**Weaknesses:**
- Can we trust fallen reason to read nature correctly?
- Different cultures reach different "natural" conclusions
- May elevate reason over revelation

### Categorical Imperatives

**The concept:** Some moral duties are absolute—binding regardless of consequences or circumstances.

**Kant's formulation:** "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

**Christian application:** Certain commands admit no exception: never murder the innocent, never worship idols, never deny Christ.

**Strengths:**
- Protects moral absolutes against situational erosion
- Provides clear guidance in complex situations
- Honors God's authority as lawgiver

**Weaknesses:**
- What about "conflicting absolutes"? (Lie to protect the innocent?)
- May miss the relational context of biblical commands
- Can become legalistic checklist

### Virtue Ethics

**The concept:** Ethics focuses on character, not just actions. What kind of person should I become?

**Aristotle:** The good life is developing virtues (courage, temperance, justice) through habit.

**Christian version:** The fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) describes Christian character. We don't just *do* right; we *become* people who do right naturally.

**Strengths:**
- Addresses motivation, not just behavior
- Integrates ethics with spiritual formation
- Allows for growth and context-sensitivity

**Weaknesses:**
- Who defines the virtues?
- Can justify almost anything if the "virtuous person" would do it
- Needs grounding in divine command or natural law

## Hebrew Approach: Covenant Faithfulness

Hebrew ethics is less about abstract principles and more about relationship.

### Walking with God

**Genesis 5:24:** "Enoch walked with God."
**Micah 6:8:** "Walk humbly with your God."

The metaphor is journey, companionship, direction. Ethics is not primarily about correct answers but faithful walking.

**Walking in His ways** (Deuteronomy 8:6): Following where God leads, not constructing independent systems.

### *Imitatio Dei*—Imitating God

**Leviticus 19:2:** "Be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy."
**Ephesians 5:1:** "Be imitators of God, as beloved children."

Ethics is about becoming like God in character and action. What does God do? Love, forgive, show mercy, execute justice, keep covenant.

**Example-based ethics:** The command is not "Here are seven principles for ethical living" but "Look at how God acts—do likewise."

### Torah as Story and Instruction

Hebrew *torah* doesn't mean "law" in the Greek sense (abstract principles). It means "instruction, teaching"—wisdom for living.

Torah is embedded in narrative: Here's what God did for you (Exodus 20:2—"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt"). Therefore, here's how you respond (the commandments).

Ethics flows from gratitude, not duty alone.

### Covenantal Context

All ethics is set within covenant relationship:
- **God's faithfulness:** He keeps His promises; we respond in kind
- **Community:** Ethics is practiced within the people of God
- **Story:** Our choices fit into God's larger narrative

Not: "Is this action abstractly right?"
But: "Is this faithful to my covenant God?"

## The Ten Commandments: A Case Study

**Greek reading:**
- Ten universal moral principles
- Applicable to all people everywhere
- Foundation for natural law

**Hebrew reading:**
- Covenant stipulations for Israel
- Response to redemption: "I brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2)
- Guidance for walking with YHWH
- First four: Relationship with God
- Last six: Relationship with neighbor

Both readings are valid. The commands are universal (grounded in God's character) AND covenantal (given to a specific people in response to specific grace).

## New Testament Ethics

### Jesus's Teaching

**Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7):** Deepens and internalizes the law. Not just no murder—no anger. Not just no adultery—no lust. The heart matters, not just behavior.

**Love command:** "Love the Lord your God... Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37-39). All law hangs on these two.

### Paul's Ethics

**Indicative → Imperative:** Paul states what God has done (indicative), then commands how to live (imperative).

"You are not your own; you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20).

Ethics flows from identity. Who you are determines how you live.

### Already/Not Yet

Ethics in the overlap of ages. The kingdom has come (Christ is risen), but not fully (sin and death remain). We live "as if"—anticipating the coming kingdom while acknowledging present realities.

## Ethical Method

How do we decide what's right in specific situations?

### 1. Biblical Authority

Scripture is the primary source for ethics. What does God's Word say?

**Challenge:** The Bible doesn't address every modern issue directly (genetic engineering, social media, etc.).

### 2. Principled Reasoning

Extract principles from biblical texts and apply to new situations.

**Example:** The Bible doesn't mention internet pornography, but principles of sexual purity, guarding the heart, and honoring marriage apply.

### 3. Wisdom and Prudence

Some decisions require judgment—weighing options, considering consequences, seeking counsel.

**Proverbs:** Wisdom navigates complex situations where simple rules don't suffice.

### 4. Community Discernment

Ethics is practiced in community. The church wrestles together with difficult questions.

"It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (Acts 15:28)—the Jerusalem council's model.

### 5. Spirit-Led Living

Galatians 5:16: "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

Ethics is not merely following rules but being led by the Spirit who produces fruit in our lives.

## The Tension

**Greek ethics asks:** What is universally right? What principles apply everywhere?

**Hebrew ethics asks:** What does faithfulness look like here, now, with this God?

**Integration:**
- Universal principles exist (God's character doesn't change)
- But they're lived out relationally, contextually, covenantally
- We need both clarity about moral truth AND sensitivity to the Spirit's leading

## Why Ethics Matters

**Not:** Be good enough for God to accept you (legalism).
**But:** Live out the transformation God has worked in you (sanctification).

Ethics is not earning salvation. It's expressing salvation. We obey not to be saved but because we are saved. We love because He first loved us.

The goal isn't moral achievement but Christ-likeness—being conformed to the image of the Son (Romans 8:29).
