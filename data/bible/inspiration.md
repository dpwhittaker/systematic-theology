How did God speak through human authors?

**Dictation Theory:** God dictated word-for-word; authors were passive secretaries.
**Verbal Plenary:** God inspired every word, but used authors' personalities and styles.
**Dynamic/Conceptual:** God inspired the concepts; authors chose the words.
**Encounter:** Authors encountered God and testified to what they experienced ([Hebrew view](#bible/testimony 'Hebrew')).

The Greek question: *How* did inspiration work mechanistically?
The Hebrew question: *Why* does God speak—to invite relationship.

# Theories of Inspiration

"All Scripture is breathed out by God" (2 Timothy 3:16). But *how*?

## Greek Systematic Theories

**1. Dictation Theory**
God dictated Scripture word-for-word. Human authors were passive instruments, like secretaries taking dictation.

*Strength:* Protects divine authority completely.
*Weakness:* Doesn't explain differences in style, vocabulary, personality between biblical authors.

**2. Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
God inspired every word (*verbal*), the whole text (*plenary*), but used the authors' personalities, backgrounds, and styles.

*How it works:* God superintended the process so that what they wrote was exactly what He intended, yet it reflects their voice.

*Most common evangelical view.*
*Strength:* Preserves both divine authority and human authorship.
*Weakness:* Hard to explain *how* God ensures exact wording while preserving genuine human agency.

**3. Dynamic/Conceptual Inspiration**
God inspired the *ideas/concepts*, but authors chose the *words* to express them.

*Strength:* More room for human agency.
*Weakness:* Risks making the text less authoritative—if words are human, could they be wrong?

**4. Neo-Orthodox View (Karl Barth)**
Scripture *becomes* the Word of God when the Spirit uses it to confront us. It's not inherently inspired—inspiration happens in the encounter.

*Strength:* Emphasizes living encounter over dead letter.
*Weakness:* Makes authority subjective—dependent on experience, not the text itself.

## The Underlying Assumption

All these theories assume we must explain *how* inspiration worked—the mechanism, the process.

This is a Greek approach: Define, systematize, explain the mechanics.

## The Hebrew Alternative

Hebrew Scripture doesn't theorize about inspiration. It simply testifies: "Thus says the LORD."

The prophets encountered God. God spoke. They testified to what they heard/saw.

**The focus is not mechanism but encounter:**
- Moses at the burning bush
- Isaiah's vision in the temple
- Jeremiah's call
- Ezekiel's visions
- John on Patmos

They encountered God. They testified. The text is their testimony.

**Authority comes from:**
- The reality of the encounter (God truly spoke)
- The faithfulness of the witness (they testified truly)
- The Spirit's role in their speaking/writing

Not from a theory of *how* inspiration works, but from the trustworthiness of God and His witnesses.

## Implications

If we focus on encounter rather than mechanism:
- We trust the testimony without needing to explain the process
- We expect diversity (different people encounter God differently)
- We receive Scripture as witness, not encyclopedia
- We're invited to encounter God ourselves through their testimony

Perhaps the question isn't "How did inspiration work?" but "Do we trust the God these witnesses encountered?"
