How did God speak through human authors?

**Dictation Theory:** God dictated word-for-word; authors were passive secretaries.
**Verbal Plenary:** God inspired every word, but used authors' personalities and styles.
**Dynamic/Conceptual:** God inspired the concepts; authors chose the words.
**Encounter:** Authors encountered God and testified to what they experienced ([Hebrew view](#bible/testimony 'Hebrew')).

The Greek question: *How* did inspiration work mechanistically?
The Hebrew question: *Why* does God speak—to invite relationship.

# Theories of Inspiration

"All Scripture is breathed out by God" (2 Timothy 3:16). But *how*?

## Greek Systematic Theories

**1. Dictation Theory**
God dictated Scripture word-for-word. Human authors were passive instruments, like secretaries taking dictation.

*Strength:* Protects divine authority completely.
*Weakness:* Doesn't explain differences in style, vocabulary, personality between biblical authors.

**2. Verbal Plenary Inspiration**
God inspired every word (*verbal*), the whole text (*plenary*), but used the authors' personalities, backgrounds, and styles.

*How it works:* God superintended the process so that what they wrote was exactly what He intended, yet it reflects their voice.

*Most common evangelical view.*
*Strength:* Preserves both divine authority and human authorship.
*Weakness:* Hard to explain *how* God ensures exact wording while preserving genuine human agency.

**3. Dynamic/Conceptual Inspiration**
God inspired the *ideas/concepts*, but authors chose the *words* to express them.

*Strength:* More room for human agency.
*Weakness:* Risks making the text less authoritative—if words are human, could they be wrong?

**4. Neo-Orthodox View (Karl Barth)**
Scripture *becomes* the Word of God when the Spirit uses it to confront us. It's not inherently inspired—inspiration happens in the encounter.

*Strength:* Emphasizes living encounter over dead letter.
*Weakness:* Makes authority subjective—dependent on experience, not the text itself.

## The Case for Verbal Plenary Inspiration

Among these views, verbal plenary inspiration has the strongest biblical warrant:

### 1. Jesus Treats Individual Words as Authoritative

**Matthew 22:32:** Jesus's argument for resurrection hinges on a *verb tense*: "I AM the God of Abraham" (not "I was"). His argument requires that specific word to be God-breathed.

**Matthew 5:18:** "Not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law." If the smallest marks matter, inspiration extends to the words themselves.

**John 10:35:** "Scripture cannot be broken." Jesus treats individual texts as inviolable.

### 2. Paul Argues from Grammar

**Galatians 3:16:** Paul distinguishes "seed" (singular) from "seeds" (plural), building theology on a single word's grammatical number: "It does not say, 'And to seeds,' as referring to many, but rather to one, 'And to your seed,' that is, Christ."

This argument only works if the exact word—not just the concept—is divinely intended.

### 3. The Spirit Speaking Through Authors

**2 Peter 1:21:** "Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."

The Spirit didn't just inspire concepts and leave word choice to human invention. The authors were "carried along"—their words were God's words, yet genuinely their own.

**Acts 1:16:** "The Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David."

The Spirit "spoke"—using David's mouth, David's words, but the Spirit's speech.

### 4. 2 Timothy 3:16—*Theopneustos*

"All Scripture is *theopneustos*"—God-breathed.

Not "Scripture contains inspired ideas" but "Scripture IS breathed out by God." The text itself, not just the concepts behind it, is the product of God's breath.

### 5. Human Personality Preserved

Verbal inspiration doesn't require mechanical dictation. Compare:
- Paul's complex Greek vs. John's simple Greek
- Isaiah's poetry vs. Ezra's lists
- Luke's research methods (Luke 1:1-4) vs. prophetic visions

God used their vocabularies, styles, and personalities. Yet what they wrote was exactly what He intended—verbal (every word) and plenary (completely).

### The Underlying Assumption

All these theories assume we must explain *how* inspiration worked—the mechanism, the process.

This is a Greek approach: Define, systematize, explain the mechanics.

## The Hebrew Alternative

Hebrew Scripture doesn't theorize about inspiration. It simply testifies: "Thus says the LORD."

The prophets encountered God. God spoke. They testified to what they heard/saw.

**The focus is not mechanism but encounter:**
- Moses at the burning bush
- Isaiah's vision in the temple
- Jeremiah's call
- Ezekiel's visions
- John on Patmos

They encountered God. They testified. The text is their testimony.

**Authority comes from:**
- The reality of the encounter (God truly spoke)
- The faithfulness of the witness (they testified truly)
- The Spirit's role in their speaking/writing

Not from a theory of *how* inspiration works, but from the trustworthiness of God and His witnesses.

## Implications

If we focus on encounter rather than mechanism:
- We trust the testimony without needing to explain the process
- We expect diversity (different people encounter God differently)
- We receive Scripture as witness, not encyclopedia
- We're invited to encounter God ourselves through their testimony

Perhaps the question isn't "How did inspiration work?" but "Do we trust the God these witnesses encountered?"
