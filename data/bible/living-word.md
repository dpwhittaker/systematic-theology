Is Scripture a fixed text from the past, or does it speak now?

**Greek view:** The Bible contains [timeless truths](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') delivered once for all. Interpretation recovers original meaning.

**Hebrew view:** The Word is *living* (Hebrews 4:12)—it speaks today. Each generation encounters God through the text anew.

The difference: Dead letter vs. living voice.

# Scripture as Living Encounter

"For the word of God is *living* and active, sharper than any two-edged sword" (Hebrews 4:12).

Not "was living" when first written. *Is* living—present tense. The Word breathes, moves, acts.

This is the Hebrew claim: **Scripture is not merely an ancient text to be studied. It's a living voice that speaks now.**

## The Greek Framework: Fixed Text, Recovered Meaning

Greek hermeneutics (interpretation theory) approaches Scripture as:

**A closed text:**
- Written in the past
- Meaning fixed at the moment of writing
- The author's original intent is the target
- Interpretation aims to recover what it meant "back then"

**The historical-critical method:**
1. Establish the original text (textual criticism)
2. Understand the historical context (who wrote it, when, to whom)
3. Determine the author's intent (what did they mean to communicate)
4. Apply that meaning to today

The assumption: Meaning is stable, located in the past, accessible through scholarly reconstruction.

**Strengths:**
- Guards against eisegesis (reading into the text what we want)
- Honors the text's historical particularity
- Provides objective criteria for interpretation

**Weakness:**
- Treats Scripture like any other ancient text
- Locates meaning in the past, not the present
- Makes encounter dependent on scholarly expertise
- Assumes God spoke once, not continuously

## The Hebrew Framework: Torah That Speaks

Jewish tradition treats Torah very differently:

**Not a closed text, but ongoing revelation:**
- The text was written in the past
- But it speaks to every generation
- The meaning unfolds, expands, is discovered anew

### "Turn it and turn it, for everything is in it"

**Mishnah, Pirkei Avot 5:22:** Ben Bag Bag said about the Torah, "Turn it over and turn it over, for everything is in it."

The image: Torah is inexhaustible. No matter how many times you read it, there's more to discover. It's not a puzzle with one solution—it's an infinite wellspring.

### The Four Levels of Meaning (PaRDeS)

Jewish interpretation recognizes multiple simultaneous levels of meaning in Torah:

**1. Peshat (פְּשָׁט)** - Simple, plain meaning
The straightforward reading of the text.

**2. Remez (רֶמֶז)** - Hint, allegory
Symbolic or allegorical meanings hinted at in the text.

**3. Derash (דְּרַשׁ)** - Interpretive, homiletical
What the text teaches morally or practically; how rabbis apply it.

**4. Sod (סוֹד)** - Secret, mystical
Hidden, mystical meanings (Kabbalistic interpretation).

The acronym PaRDeS (פרדס) means "orchard" or "paradise"—the four levels are the garden of Torah.

**Key point:** All four levels are valid simultaneously. Peshat doesn't cancel remez. The text means all of these at once.

This is radically different from the Greek search for "the" meaning.

## Midrash: The Text Speaks Again

**Midrash** (from *darash*, "to seek" or "to interpret") is the Jewish practice of interpreting Torah through creative storytelling, filling gaps, exploring contradictions.

**Example - Binding of Isaac (Genesis 22):**

The text says Isaac was taken to be sacrificed, then a ram was provided. But what was Isaac thinking? Was he afraid? Did he know? What did he and Abraham talk about on the way home?

**Midrash fills these gaps:**
- Some rabbis say Isaac was a willing participant, knowing and accepting
- Others say he didn't know until the last moment
- Some speculate he experienced death and resurrection (the ram died in his place)
- One tradition: Isaac's soul briefly left his body, seeing heaven

Are these "what really happened"? No. They're **interpretive explorations**—ways of entering the text, wrestling with it, letting it speak to new questions.

The goal isn't historical reconstruction. It's **living encounter with the text**.

### The Text Has Seventy Faces

**Midrash Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15:** "There are seventy faces to the Torah. Turn it around and around, for everything is in it."

The number seventy symbolizes completeness, multitude. Torah doesn't have one face—it has many. Each reader sees a different facet.

**This is not relativism** ("the text means whatever you want"). It's **layered richness**—the text holds multiple valid meanings because it's God's word, not human prose.

## Present-Tense Liturgy

Jewish liturgical practice treats Torah as present-tense:

**"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the Universe, *who gives* the Torah"**—not "who gave" but "who gives."

Every Sabbath, when Torah is read in synagogue, it's not commemorating an ancient event. It's **receiving the Torah anew**. God is giving it today.

**The Passover Seder:** "In every generation, each person must see themselves as if they personally came out of Egypt."

Not "our ancestors came out." *We* came out. The past event is present reality. We participate in the Exodus now.

This is not metaphor. It's how Hebrew thought relates to Scripture: **The text makes past events present. We encounter them now.**

## Christian Parallels: Living and Active

The New Testament echoes this Hebrew understanding:

**Hebrews 4:12:** "For the word of God is *living* and active..."

Not dormant. Not archived. Living. Active. Present tense.

**2 Timothy 3:16:** "All Scripture is *breathed out* by God..."

The Greek is *theopneustos* (θεόπνευστος)—"God-breathed." Breath is living, present. God breathes through Scripture now, not just once when it was written.

**John 5:39-40:** Jesus rebukes the Pharisees: "You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life."

They treat Scripture as dead letter—information to master. Jesus says it's testimony, witness, pointing to a living encounter. But they miss the encounter while studying the text.

**Luke 24:27:** On the road to Emmaus, Jesus "interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."

Jesus doesn't say "those ancient texts prefigured me." He says the Scriptures *speak* about him—present tense. The old texts are living word, speaking now about Christ.

## The Protestant Dilemma

The Reformation emphasized *sola scriptura*—Scripture alone as authority. This was a corrective against church tradition being placed above Scripture.

But it also led to a Greek framework:
- The Bible is a closed canon
- Its meaning is fixed
- Interpretation is about recovering original intent
- We systematize the propositions it contains

**The result:** Scripture becomes a doctrinal sourcebook, not living encounter.

**The irony:** In elevating Scripture's authority, we made it a dead letter—something to study, systematize, extract truths from. Not something that *speaks*.

### The Catholic and Orthodox Response

Catholicism and Orthodoxy emphasize **Tradition** alongside Scripture. The church's ongoing interpretation is authoritative.

This preserves something Hebrew: The text doesn't stand alone. It's interpreted within a living community, across generations, through ongoing encounter.

But it also risks making the church's interpretation equal to or above Scripture itself.

## The Hebrew Alternative

What if we approach Scripture as:

**Living Torah:**
- Written in the past
- Speaking to the present
- Inexhaustible in meaning
- Encountered in community
- Requiring wisdom, not just exegesis

**We read asking:**
- What is God saying to us through this?
- How does this text speak to our situation?
- What new facets do we see that previous generations missed?

**We trust:**
- The text is richer than any one reading
- Multiple interpretations can coexist
- God's word is living, not archived
- Encounter matters more than mastery

## The Risk: Anything Goes?

The objection: If the text speaks anew to each generation, doesn't that make interpretation subjective? Can it mean anything?

**The Hebrew response:**
No, because:

1. **The text itself constrains:** You can't make it say anything. The words are fixed. But within those words, there's richness.

2. **Community interprets:** Not individuals alone, but the people of God together, across generations. The Talmud is centuries of rabbis arguing—community interpretation.

3. **Tradition guides:** Not as binding law, but as wisdom. We don't ignore how previous generations read the text.

4. **The Spirit illuminates:** For Christians, the Holy Spirit guides into truth (John 16:13). This is not individual subjectivism—it's reliance on God's ongoing teaching.

**The difference from Greek objectivism:**
- Greek: One correct meaning, recoverable by method
- Hebrew: Multiple valid meanings, discovered through encounter

Both have guardrails. Hebrew guardrails are community, tradition, Spirit. Greek guardrails are method, original intent, systematic coherence.

Which is more faithful to Scripture's own claims about itself?

## Implications

If Scripture is living word:

**We approach it differently:**
- Not just study, but meditation (Hebrew *hagah*—murmuring, pondering)
- Not extracting timeless truths, but encountering God
- Not mastering content, but being shaped by the text
- Not systematic theology, but ongoing relationship

**We expect it to speak new things:**
- Not contradicting past interpretations, but adding layers
- Not making the old obsolete, but enriching it
- Not "new revelation" beyond Scripture, but new depths within it

**We read in community:**
- Listening to how others encounter the text
- Learning from tradition without being bound by it
- Wrestling together, not alone

**We trust the text is alive:**
- It's not a problem to solve but a voice to hear
- It's not information to master but wisdom to receive
- It's not dead letter but living Word

Perhaps the Bible is less like an encyclopedia and more like a person—someone you know, who speaks, who surprises you, who can't be reduced to propositions.

Perhaps we're meant to *encounter* Scripture, not just study it.

Perhaps the Word is living after all.
