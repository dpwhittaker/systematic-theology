The written *Word of God*. But is it a collection of [timeless propositions](#bible/inspiration 'Greek') or a [living testimony](#bible/torah 'Hebrew')?

**Greek approach:** Define what Scripture *is*.
- [Inspiration](#bible/inspiration 'Greek'): How God spoke through human authors (verbal, plenary, dictation theories).
- [Inerrancy](#bible/inerrancy 'Greek'): Is the Bible without error in all it affirms?
- [Canon](#bible/canon 'Greek'): Which books belong? Closed list, fixed forever.
- [Interpretation](#bible/interpretation 'Greek'): Extract universal truths through systematic methods.

**Hebrew approach:** Engage with what God is *saying*.
- [Torah as Instruction](#bible/torah 'Hebrew'): Not rulebook but relational guidance for covenant life.
- [Living Word](#bible/midrash#living-encounter 'Hebrew'): Scripture speaks now, not just then—continual encounter.
- [Midrash](#bible/midrash 'Hebrew'): Wrestling with the text, multiple interpretations coexist.
- [Testimony](#bible/testimony 'Hebrew'): Witness to God's acts, not systematic doctrine manual.

Can both be true? Is Scripture propositional truth or narrative encounter?
