The written *Word of God*.

Key questions:
- *Inspiration* - How did God speak through human authors?
- *Authority* - Is Scripture our final rule for faith and practice?
- *Interpretation* - How do we understand what we read?
- *Canon* - Which books belong in the Bible?
- *Inerrancy* - Is the Bible without error?

The Hebrew approach asks: What is God *saying*?
The Greek approach asks: What *is* Scripture?
