title: Inerrancy

[Bible](#bible/bible 'Parent')

Is the Bible without error in all it affirms?

**Full Inerrancy:** No errors in theology, history, science, geography—everything Scripture touches.
**Limited Inerrancy:** No errors in matters of faith and practice, but may have minor historical/scientific imprecision.
**Infallibility:** Scripture accomplishes its purpose (leading to salvation) without error, though may have factual mistakes.

The debate assumes Scripture functions as [propositional encyclopedia](#intro/philosophy 'Greek').
Hebrew view: Scripture is [testimony](#bible/testimony 'Hebrew')—true witness, not exhaustive encyclopedia.

# The Inerrancy Debate

**Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978):** "Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching."

This sparked decades of debate: Does inerrancy extend to science? History? Numbers? Grammar?

## Levels of Inerrancy

**1. Absolute/Full Inerrancy**
Everything Scripture affirms is without error—theology, history, science, geography, numbers.

*Problem:* Scripture seems to have discrepancies (different numbers in parallel accounts, different genealogies, apparent scientific statements like "the sun stood still").

*Response:* These are apparent contradictions, not real ones. Harmonization is possible.

**2. Limited Inerrancy**
Scripture is inerrant in matters of "faith and practice" (theology, morality) but may have minor errors in incidental historical/scientific details.

*Problem:* Who decides what's "incidental"? If Scripture errs on history, can we trust it on theology?

**3. Infallibility (not Inerrancy)**
Scripture infallibly accomplishes its purpose (2 Timothy 3:16-17—teaching, reproof, training in righteousness) but may have factual errors that don't affect that purpose.

*Problem:* Seems to lower Scripture's authority.

## The Underlying Question

Why do we need inerrancy?

**The logic:**
1. God is truth; He cannot lie
2. Scripture is God's word
3. Therefore, Scripture cannot contain error

**The assumption:** Scripture functions like propositional statements. If any proposition is false, the whole is unreliable.

## The Hebrew Alternative

Hebrew Scripture doesn't claim inerrancy—it claims *trustworthiness*.

**Deuteronomy 18:21-22:** How do you know a prophet speaks for God? "If the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken."

The test is not propositional perfection but faithful witness. Did what the prophet said happen?

**John 21:24-25:** "This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things that Jesus did..."

The claim: *True testimony*, not exhaustive record.

## Testimony vs. Encyclopedia

**Encyclopedia:** Claims comprehensiveness and precision. Errors undermine trust.

**Testimony:** Claims truthful witness to what was seen/experienced. Minor imprecision (which day? how many people?) doesn't undermine the core testimony.

**Example:**
Four Gospels give different details about Jesus's resurrection. How many women? How many angels? What did they say?

*Inerrancy approach:* Harmonize the accounts to show there's no contradiction.

*Testimony approach:* Four witnesses saw the empty tomb and encountered the risen Christ. They testify truthfully, though details differ (as eyewitness accounts often do).

The core testimony: Christ is risen. That's what matters.

## Perhaps We're Asking the Wrong Question

Instead of "Is the Bible inerrant?" maybe ask:
- Is Scripture's testimony to God's character and acts trustworthy?
- Does it faithfully witness to Jesus Christ?
- Does it accomplish its purpose of leading us to God?

If yes, then Scripture is authoritative—not because it's an inerrant encyclopedia, but because it's trustworthy testimony to the living God.
