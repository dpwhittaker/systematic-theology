title: Midrash and the Living Word
shortTitle: Midrash
---
[Bible](#bible/bible 'Parent')
---
Midrash (מִדְרָשׁ) - from *darash* (דרש): to seek, to search, to interpret.

Not extracting [propositions](#intro/philosophy 'Greek'), but wrestling with the text like Jacob wrestled the angel (Genesis 32).
Multiple rabbis, multiple interpretations, all preserved. *Eilu v'eilu*—"These and these are the words of the living God."

The [Greek](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') mind seeks one correct answer.
The [Hebrew](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew') mind embraces paradox and multiplicity.

And Scripture itself claims: "The word of God is *living* and active" (Hebrews 4:12)—not was, but *is*.

# Scripture as Living Encounter {#living-encounter}

"For the word of God is *living* and active, sharper than any two-edged sword" (Hebrews 4:12).

Not "was living" when first written. *Is* living—present tense. The Word breathes, moves, acts.

This is the Hebrew claim: **Scripture is not merely an ancient text to be studied. It's a living voice that speaks now.**

## The Greek Framework: Fixed Text, Recovered Meaning {#greek-framework}

Greek hermeneutics (interpretation theory) approaches Scripture as:

**A closed text:**
- Written in the past
- Meaning fixed at the moment of writing
- The author's original intent is the target
- Interpretation aims to recover what it meant "back then"

**The historical-critical method:**
1. Establish the original text (textual criticism)
2. Understand the historical context (who wrote it, when, to whom)
3. Determine the author's intent (what did they mean to communicate)
4. Apply that meaning to today

The assumption: Meaning is stable, located in the past, accessible through scholarly reconstruction.

**Strengths:**
- Guards against eisegesis (reading into the text what we want)
- Honors the text's historical particularity
- Provides objective criteria for interpretation

**Weakness:**
- Treats Scripture like any other ancient text
- Locates meaning in the past, not the present
- Makes encounter dependent on scholarly expertise
- Assumes God spoke once, not continuously

## The Hebrew Framework: Torah That Speaks {#hebrew-framework}

Jewish tradition treats [Torah](#bible/torah 'Hebrew') very differently:

**Not a closed text, but ongoing revelation:**
- The text was written in the past
- But it speaks to every generation
- The meaning unfolds, expands, is discovered anew

### "Turn It and Turn It, For Everything Is In It" {#turn-it}

**Mishnah, Pirkei Avot 5:22:** Ben Bag Bag said about the Torah, "Turn it over and turn it over, for everything is in it."

The image: Torah is inexhaustible. No matter how many times you read it, there's more to discover. It's not a puzzle with one solution—it's an infinite wellspring.

**Midrash Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15:** "There are seventy faces to the Torah. Turn it around and around, for everything is in it."

The number seventy symbolizes completeness, multitude. Torah doesn't have one face—it has many. Each reader sees a different facet.

**This is not relativism** ("the text means whatever you want"). It's **layered richness**—the text holds multiple valid meanings because it's God's word, not human prose.

## The Four Levels of Meaning - PaRDeS {#pardes}

Jewish interpretation recognizes multiple simultaneous levels of meaning in Torah:

**1. Peshat (פְּשָׁט)** - Simple, plain meaning
The straightforward reading of the text. What does it say on the surface?

**2. Remez (רֶמֶז)** - Hint, allegory
Symbolic or allegorical meanings hinted at in the text.

**3. Derash (דְּרַשׁ)** - Interpretive, homiletical
What the text teaches morally or practically; how rabbis apply it.

**4. Sod (סוֹד)** - Secret, mystical
Hidden, mystical meanings (Kabbalistic interpretation).

The acronym PaRDeS (פרדס) means "orchard" or "paradise"—the four levels are the garden of Torah.

**Key point:** All four levels are valid simultaneously. Peshat doesn't cancel remez. Derash doesn't replace peshat. The text means all of these at once.

This is radically different from the Greek search for "the" meaning.

**Example - "And Abraham rose early in the morning" (Genesis 22:3):**

- **Peshat:** Abraham woke up early.
- **Remez:** Early = eager, zealous (dawn symbolizes new beginning)
- **Derash:** Abraham was eager to obey God. He didn't delay or hesitate. Early rising shows zealous devotion.
- **Sod:** Abraham rose from spiritual slumber to enlightenment about God's nature.

Is the derash or sod "reading into" the text? Or is it drawing out implications that are truly there?

Hebrew tradition says: If it's rooted in the text and leads to deeper understanding of God's character, it's valid.

# The Interpretive Tradition {#midrash-tradition}

Midrash is the Jewish practice of interpreting Torah creatively, filling gaps in the narrative, exploring contradictions, asking "what if?" and "why?" It's not dispassionate scholarship—it's passionate engagement.

## What Midrash Does {#what-midrash-does}

**Fills narrative gaps:**
Scripture often leaves things unsaid. Midrash fills these silences with imaginative interpretation.

**Example - Abraham and the Idols:**
Genesis doesn't tell us how Abraham came to know the one God. He just appears called by God in Genesis 12.

**Midrash (Genesis Rabbah 38:13):** Young Abraham worked in his father Terah's idol shop. One day, he smashed all the idols except the largest, then placed a stick in the big idol's hand. When Terah asked what happened, Abraham said "The largest idol got angry and smashed the others." Terah replied, "Idols can't do that!" Abraham responded, "Then why do you worship them?"

Is this "what really happened"? The text doesn't say. But midrash explores: How did Abraham come to reject idolatry? What might have led him to the one God?

**Example - Binding of Isaac (Genesis 22):**

The text says Isaac was taken to be sacrificed, then a ram was provided. But what was Isaac thinking? Was he afraid? Did he know? What did he and Abraham talk about on the way home?

**Midrash fills these gaps:**
- Some rabbis say Isaac was a willing participant, knowing and accepting
- Others say he didn't know until the last moment
- Some speculate he experienced death and resurrection (the ram died in his place)
- One tradition: Isaac's soul briefly left his body, seeing heaven

Are these "what really happened"? No. They're **interpretive explorations**—ways of entering the text, wrestling with it, letting it speak to new questions.

The goal isn't historical reconstruction. It's **living encounter with the text**.

**Resolves contradictions:**
When the text seems to contradict itself, midrash doesn't smooth it over—it explores both sides.

**Explores theological problems:**
Why does God test Abraham? How could a good God command child sacrifice? Midrash doesn't give pat answers—it wrestles.

**Applies to new situations:**
How does this ancient text speak to us now? Midrash bridges past and present.

## Types of Midrash {#types-of-midrash}

**Midrash Halakha** - Legal interpretation
How do we apply Torah's commands? What does "remember the Sabbath" mean in practice?

**Midrash Aggadah** - Narrative interpretation
Story, theology, ethics. More creative, less binding. This is where the imaginative gap-filling happens.

## The Talmudic Method {#talmudic-method}

The **Talmud** (completed ~500-600 AD) is the written record of centuries of rabbinic debate about Torah.

**Structure:**
- **Mishnah** (core text, ~200 AD): Brief legal rulings and teachings
- **Gemara** (commentary, ~500-600 AD): Rabbis arguing about the Mishnah

**What's stunning:** The Talmud preserves *both sides* of arguments. Minority opinions are recorded alongside majority rulings. Contradictions are left unresolved.

**Example format:**
*Rabbi Akiva says:* [Opinion A]
*Rabbi Ishmael says:* [Opinion B, contradicting A]
*The sages taught:* [Opinion C, different from both]

And often, no resolution. Just the record of the debate.

## *Eilu v'eilu* - These and These {#eilu-veilu}

**Talmud, Eruvin 13b:**

"For three years, the House of Hillel and the House of Shammai disputed. These said, 'The law follows our opinion,' and these said, 'The law follows our opinion.' A heavenly voice proclaimed: '*Eilu v'eilu divrei Elohim chaim*'—These and these are the words of the living God. But the law follows the House of Hillel."

Read that again: **Both sides are "the words of the living God"**—even though they contradict each other.

How is this possible?

**The Hebrew answer:** Truth is not univocal. Reality—especially divine reality—is richer than human logic. Two contradictory statements can both be true from different perspectives.

God's word is living, layered, multifaceted. It has seventy faces. The text holds more than one meaning.

**The Greek mind questions this.** The law of non-contradiction: A cannot be both B and not-B in the same sense at the same time.

**The Hebrew mind embraces paradox.** God's truth exceeds our logic.

**But wait:** The law of non-contradiction isn't arbitrary Greek philosophy—it's the foundation of meaningful speech.

If A and not-A can both be true in the same sense at the same time, then:
- "Jesus rose from the dead" means nothing (because "Jesus didn't rise" is equally true)
- "God is good" means nothing (because "God is not good" is equally true)
- "Love your neighbor" means nothing (because "hate your neighbor" is equally true)
- All theology collapses into incoherence

*Eilu v'eilu* doesn't actually reject logic. It recognizes that:
- Both rabbinic schools see *part* of a complex truth
- Both approaches have wisdom to contribute
- Practical rulings still must be made (the law follows Hillel, not both simultaneously)

This is **complementary perspectives on ONE truth**, not contradictory claims both being true in the same sense.

**The Hebrew insight:** Truth is richer than simple either/or. Multiple perspectives illuminate different facets of reality.

**The Greek safeguard:** Actual contradictions destroy meaning. If anything can be affirmed, nothing is affirmed.

Both are needed.

## Multiple Meanings, Not Relativism {#not-relativism}

**The objection:** If the text can mean many things, doesn't that make interpretation arbitrary?

**The response:** No, because:

**1. The text constrains:**
You can't make it say anything. The words are fixed. Derash must connect to peshat.

**2. Community evaluates:**
Midrash happens in community. Rabbis debate, challenge, refine interpretations. Not everything proposed is accepted.

**3. Tradition guides:**
Past interpretations are respected. You can add new layers, but you don't reject what came before.

**4. Coherence with Torah's spirit:**
Does this interpretation align with Torah's overall message—God's character, covenant faithfulness, justice and mercy?

So it's not "anything goes." But it's also not "one correct answer."

**The Greek method** (historical-critical) asks: What did the author mean?
**The Hebrew method** (midrashic) asks: What does the text teach us?

Different questions. Different goals.

# Present-Tense Liturgy {#present-tense}

Jewish liturgical practice treats Torah as present-tense:

**"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the Universe, *who gives* the Torah"**—not "who gave" but "who gives."

Every Sabbath, when Torah is read in synagogue, it's not commemorating an ancient event. It's **receiving the Torah anew**. God is giving it today.

**The Passover Seder:** "In every generation, each person must see themselves as if they personally came out of Egypt."

Not "our ancestors came out." *We* came out. The past event is present reality. We participate in the Exodus now.

This is not metaphor. It's how Hebrew thought relates to Scripture: **The text makes past events present. We encounter them now.**

# Christian Parallels {#christian-parallels}

## Scripture Is Living {#scripture-living}

The New Testament echoes this Hebrew understanding:

**Hebrews 4:12:** "For the word of God is *living* and active..."

Not dormant. Not archived. Living. Active. Present tense.

**2 Timothy 3:16:** "All Scripture is *breathed out* by God..."

The Greek is *theopneustos* (θεόπνευστος)—"God-breathed." Breath is living, present. God breathes through Scripture now, not just once when it was written.

**John 5:39-40:** Jesus rebukes the Pharisees: "You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life."

They treat Scripture as dead letter—information to master. Jesus says it's testimony, witness, pointing to a living encounter. But they miss the encounter while studying the text.

**Luke 24:27:** On the road to Emmaus, Jesus "interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."

Jesus doesn't say "those ancient texts prefigured me." He says the Scriptures *speak* about him—present tense. The old texts are living word, speaking now about Christ.

## Midrashic Interpretation in the New Testament {#nt-midrash}

The New Testament uses midrashic methods:

**Paul's use of allegory (Galatians 4:21-31):**
Paul allegorizes Hagar and Sarah—Hagar represents Sinai covenant, Sarah represents new covenant. He explicitly says "these things are being spoken allegorically."

Is this the "original meaning" of Genesis? No. It's midrash—Paul finds Christ and the Gospel in the old story.

**Matthew's use of typology:**
"Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1, referring to Israel) is applied to Jesus (Matthew 2:15).

Is this what Hosea meant? No. But Matthew sees a pattern—God's son (Israel) came out of Egypt, now God's Son (Jesus) comes out of Egypt. The text speaks again in a new key.

**Hebrews and the tabernacle:**
Hebrews reads the entire tabernacle system as pointing to Christ (Hebrews 8-10). Every detail—priesthood, sacrifices, Day of Atonement—is Christological.

Is this the original intent of Leviticus? No. But is it a valid reading of how those old institutions find fulfillment in Christ? Yes.

**This is midrashic interpretation.** The apostles weren't doing modern historical-critical exegesis. They were reading Scripture the way their Jewish teachers taught them—finding new depths, new applications, Christ hidden in the old covenant.

# The Protestant Dilemma {#protestant-dilemma}

The Reformation emphasized *sola scriptura*—Scripture alone as authority. This was a corrective against church tradition being placed above Scripture.

But it also led to a Greek framework:
- The Bible is a closed canon
- Its meaning is fixed
- Interpretation is about recovering original intent
- We systematize the propositions it contains

**The result:** Scripture becomes a doctrinal sourcebook, not living encounter.

**The irony:** In elevating Scripture's authority, we made it a dead letter—something to study, systematize, extract truths from. Not something that *speaks*.

## The Catholic and Orthodox Response {#catholic-orthodox}

Catholicism and Orthodoxy emphasize **Tradition** alongside Scripture. The church's ongoing interpretation is authoritative.

This preserves something Hebrew: The text doesn't stand alone. It's interpreted within a living community, across generations, through ongoing encounter.

But it also risks making the church's interpretation equal to or above Scripture itself.

## The Hebrew Alternative {#hebrew-alternative}

What if we approach Scripture as:

**Living Torah:**
- Written in the past
- Speaking to the present
- Inexhaustible in meaning
- Encountered in community
- Requiring wisdom, not just exegesis

**We read asking:**
- What is God saying to us through this?
- How does this text speak to our situation?
- What new facets do we see that previous generations missed?

**We trust:**
- The text is richer than any one reading
- Multiple interpretations can coexist
- God's word is living, not archived
- Encounter matters more than mastery

## The Risk: Anything Goes? {#anything-goes}

The objection: If the text speaks anew to each generation, doesn't that make interpretation subjective? Can it mean anything?

**The Hebrew response:**
No, because:

1. **The text itself constrains:** You can't make it say anything. The words are fixed. But within those words, there's richness.

2. **Community interprets:** Not individuals alone, but the people of God together, across generations. The Talmud is centuries of rabbis arguing—community interpretation.

3. **Tradition guides:** Not as binding law, but as wisdom. We don't ignore how previous generations read the text.

4. **The Spirit illuminates:** For Christians, the Holy Spirit guides into truth (John 16:13). This is not individual subjectivism—it's reliance on God's ongoing teaching.

**The difference from Greek objectivism:**
- Greek: One correct meaning, recoverable by method
- Hebrew: Multiple valid meanings, discovered through encounter

Both have guardrails. Hebrew guardrails are community, tradition, Spirit. Greek guardrails are method, original intent, systematic coherence.

Which is more faithful to Scripture's own claims about itself?

# The Risk: Eisegesis {#eisegesis}

**Eisegesis** = reading into the text what isn't there.
**Exegesis** = reading out of the text what is there.

Greek method fears eisegesis. It wants objective, historical, original meaning to guard against reading our ideas into Scripture.

Hebrew method acknowledges: **We always bring ourselves to the text.** Our questions, our context, our concerns. The goal isn't to become neutral (impossible) but to let the text speak to us where we are.

Midrash isn't eisegesis because it's **conscious** about what it's doing. It's saying "Here's one way to read this. Here's what this text might teach us."

Eisegesis pretends to be objective while smuggling in assumptions.
Midrash is openly interpretive—and that's honest.

# Wrestling, Not Mastering {#wrestling}

Genesis 32: Jacob wrestles with God (or an angel—the text is ambiguous). He struggles all night. At dawn, he's wounded but blessed.

**This is the model for engaging Scripture.** Not mastering it, but wrestling with it. Not standing above it analyzing, but grappling with it until it blesses you.

**Midrash is wrestling:**
- You bring your questions, your struggles, your life
- The text resists, challenges, surprises
- You don't walk away with neat answers
- You walk away transformed, blessed, limping

"I will not let you go unless you bless me" (Genesis 32:26).

That's how to read Scripture.

# The Danger of Systematization {#systematization}

Greek theology systematizes Scripture—extracts propositions, builds coherent doctrines, resolves contradictions.

**The result:** We master the text. We have it figured out. We know what it says.

But can you master the living God? Can you systematize YHWH?

**Midrash resists this.** It keeps the text open, layered, inexhaustible. It refuses closure.

"Turn it and turn it, for everything is in it."

You never reach the bottom. There's always more.

Perhaps that's the point. Perhaps Scripture is meant to be inexhaustible, not mastered.

Perhaps we're meant to wrestle, not systematize.

Perhaps the text is alive—and alive things can't be pinned down.

# Implications {#implications}

If Scripture is living word:

**We approach it differently:**
- Not just study, but meditation (Hebrew *hagah*—murmuring, pondering; see [Wrestling](#intro/wrestling 'Hebrew'))
- Not extracting timeless truths, but encountering God
- Not mastering content, but being shaped by the text
- Not systematic theology, but ongoing relationship

**We expect it to speak new things:**
- Not contradicting past interpretations, but adding layers
- Not making the old obsolete, but enriching it
- Not "new revelation" beyond Scripture, but new depths within it

**We read in community:**
- Listening to how others encounter the text
- Learning from tradition without being bound by it
- Wrestling together, not alone

**We trust the text is alive:**
- It's not a problem to solve but a voice to hear
- It's not information to master but wisdom to receive
- It's not dead letter but living Word

Perhaps the Bible is less like an encyclopedia and more like a person—someone you know, who speaks, who surprises you, who can't be reduced to propositions.

Perhaps we're meant to *encounter* Scripture, not just study it.

Perhaps the Word is living after all.
