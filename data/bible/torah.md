Torah (תּוֹרָה) means *instruction*, not "law."

Not a legal code to obey for salvation, but covenant guidance for how God's people live.
Not abstract principles, but relational wisdom: "This is how we live because of who we belong to."

The [Greek](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') mind extracts universal rules.
The [Hebrew](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew') mind receives ongoing instruction from a living God.

# Torah: Teaching, Not Legislation

When we translate Torah as "Law," we've already imposed a Greek framework. Torah is not primarily legal code—it's *instruction*, *teaching*, *guidance*. It's how a Father teaches His children to live.

## The Hebrew Meaning

**Torah** (תּוֹרָה) comes from the verb *yarah* (ירה) meaning "to throw," "to shoot an arrow," or "to point the way." It's directional—showing the path, not legislating behavior.

**Related meanings:**
- Instruction from a parent (Proverbs 1:8—"the Torah of your mother")
- Priestly teaching about ritual purity
- Prophetic instruction
- The first five books of Scripture (Pentateuch)
- All of Scripture in broader usage

Torah is what God teaches His people about how to walk with Him.

## Torah in Context: Covenant Relationship

Critical fact: **The giving of Torah comes AFTER deliverance from Egypt.**

**Exodus 20:2** (before the Ten Commandments): "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery."

The order matters:
1. God delivers Israel (grace, relationship established)
2. God gives Torah (instruction for living in that relationship)

Torah is not "do this to earn God's favor." It's "you're My people—here's how My people live."

### Like Marriage Vows

A man and woman marry first (covenant established), then learn how to live together. The instructions for marriage ("be faithful," "love and respect") aren't conditions to become married—they're how marriage flourishes.

Similarly:
- **Grace**: God chooses Israel, delivers them, makes covenant
- **Torah**: Instruction for how to live as God's covenant people

This is fundamentally relational, not legal.

## Torah vs. Greek Nomoi (Laws)

**Greek nomos** (νόμος) = law in the abstract sense:
- Universal rules
- Binding obligations
- Legislated requirements
- Violations incur penalties

**Hebrew Torah** = instruction in the relational sense:
- Specific guidance for this people
- Covenantal expectations
- Formative wisdom
- Violations damage relationship

When the New Testament (written in Greek) translates Torah as *nomos*, meaning shifts. Paul's arguments about "works of law" vs. faith make more sense when we remember Torah is covenant instruction, not abstract legal code.

**Paul's not rejecting Torah as God's good instruction.** He's rejecting the idea that Gentiles must become Jews (circumcision, dietary laws) to be in Christ. The new covenant includes Gentiles without requiring Torah observance.

But this gets obscured when Torah becomes "Law" and the debate becomes "grace vs. law" instead of "which covenant are we in?"

## Torah as Living Instruction

Here's the radical Hebrew claim: **Torah is not a closed, static text. It's living, speaking, unfolding.**

### Oral Torah

Rabbinic Judaism distinguishes:
- **Written Torah**: The five books of Moses
- **Oral Torah**: Interpretive traditions, explanations, applications

The claim: Moses received both at Sinai. The Oral Torah interprets and applies the Written Torah to new situations.

This is formalized in the **Mishnah** (compiled ~200 AD) and **Talmud** (completed ~500-600 AD)—generations of rabbis debating how Torah applies to life.

**Why does this matter?** Because Torah is not just ancient text—it's ongoing instruction. Each generation engages the text anew, asking "What does God's instruction mean for us, now?"

This is **radically different** from the Protestant emphasis on "Scripture alone" (sola scriptura) where the text is closed and interpretation is about recovering original meaning.

### Torah Speaks Now

**Jewish liturgy:** "Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the Universe, who gives the Torah."

Present tense. Not "who gave" but "who gives." Torah is continual revelation.

**Midrash** (Jewish interpretive tradition) asks: What is the text saying to us today? Not just "What did it mean then?" but "What does it mean now?"

This allows for multiple, even contradictory interpretations. The Talmud preserves minority opinions alongside majority rulings. Truth is layered, not singular.

## The Greek Imposition: Systematic Extraction

Greek philosophy wants to extract universal truths from Torah and systematize them.

**The move:**
1. Read Torah narratives
2. Extract principles ("God values justice," "Humans are sinful")
3. Systematize into doctrine
4. Claim these are timeless, universal truths

**Example:**
- Torah: "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13)
- Greek extraction: Universal moral law against taking human life
- Systematized: Part of natural law, knowable by reason, applicable to all cultures

But Torah is more specific:
- It's instruction to *Israel*
- In the context of *covenant*
- As part of *how God's people live*

It's not a universal moral code—it's God's instruction to His people about murder within the covenant community.

Does this mean murder is fine for non-Israelites? Of course not. But the point is: **Torah is covenant instruction, not universal legislation.**

When we turn it into abstract moral law, we've imposed Greek categories onto Hebrew revelation.

## Propositional Truth vs. Relational Instruction

**Greek approach to Scripture:**
Scripture contains propositional truths. Extract them, systematize them, build doctrine.

"God is love" (1 John 4:8) becomes:
- A proposition about God's essence
- Timeless, universal, always true
- Can be defined philosophically

**Hebrew approach to Torah:**
Torah is God instructing His people in relationship. Listen, respond, live it out.

"You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart" (Deuteronomy 6:5) is:
- A relational command
- Requires covenant context
- Enacted in specific faithfulness

The difference: One treats Scripture as source of information. The other treats it as invitation to relationship.

## Implications for Reading Scripture

If we read the Bible as Torah (instruction) rather than Law (legislation):

**We expect:**
- Narrative and story (not just principles)
- Commands embedded in relationship (not abstract rules)
- Ongoing encounter (not one-time delivery of information)
- Multiple valid interpretations (not one correct reading)
- Application requires wisdom (not mere obedience)

**We ask:**
- What is God teaching us through this?
- How does this shape our covenant life?
- What does this reveal about God's character?

**Not:**
- What universal principle can we extract?
- What doctrinal statement does this support?
- How does this fit into our systematic theology?

## The Christian Question

Christians affirm the Old Testament (Torah, Prophets, Writings) as Scripture. But how?

**Common Christian approaches:**

**1. Fulfilled and transcended:**
Torah was for Israel under the old covenant. Christ fulfilled it. We're under a new covenant. Torah is instructive but not binding.

**2. Moral vs. Ceremonial:**
Separate Torah into moral law (still binding—Ten Commandments) and ceremonial law (no longer binding—sacrifices, dietary laws). Keep the moral, discard the ceremonial.

**3. Christocentric reading:**
All of Torah points to Christ. Read it typologically—manna is Christ, Passover lamb is Christ, tabernacle is Christ.

**Problems with each:**
1. Doesn't explain why we still appeal to Torah when convenient ("Remember the Sabbath")
2. No biblical warrant for the moral/ceremonial distinction—it's a later theological category
3. Risks flattening Torah into allegory, losing its plain sense

**Hebrew framework alternative:**

What if we simply receive Torah as God's instruction to Israel under the old covenant—and let it remain that?

We're Gentiles in Christ. We're not under Torah as covenant instruction for Israel. But we can learn from it:
- How God instructs His people
- What covenant faithfulness looks like
- God's character revealed through His instructions

We don't have to make Torah "apply" to us directly. We can honor it as God's word to Israel and receive wisdom from it without forcing it into our covenant.

## The Living Word

Ultimately, the Hebrew insight is this: **Scripture is not a closed system of propositional truths. It's living instruction from a living God.**

This doesn't mean "anything goes" in interpretation. It means:
- The text is rich, layered, inexhaustible
- It speaks to each generation anew
- Engaging it is relationship, not information extraction
- Multiple interpretations can coexist without one being "right"

**The Greek mind resists this.** It wants clarity, system, univocal meaning.

**The Hebrew mind embraces this.** It trusts that God's instruction exceeds human systematization, that wrestling with the text is how we encounter God.

Perhaps Scripture is more like Torah—ongoing instruction from a Father—than like a systematic theology textbook.

Perhaps we're meant to live in it, argue with it, let it shape us—not master it, systematize it, reduce it to propositions.

Perhaps the Living Word speaks in ways our categories can't contain.
