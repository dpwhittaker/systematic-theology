Which books belong in the Bible?

**Greek approach:** Define criteria (apostolic authorship, orthodoxy, widespread use), apply systematically, close the canon.

**Hebrew approach:** These are the books the [community](#bible/torah 'Hebrew') has received, read, found life-giving. Canon emerges from use, not decree.

Protestant (66 books), Catholic (73 books with Apocrypha), Orthodox (more books still). Who decides?

# Which Books Are Scripture?

The word "canon" (κανών) means "rule" or "measuring rod." Which books measure up? Which are authoritative?

## How the Canon Formed

**Old Testament:**
Jews recognized Torah (5 books), Prophets, and Writings by the time of Jesus. The exact list wasn't formally closed until later (Council of Jamnia, ~90 AD, though this is debated).

**New Testament:**
Early church had the four Gospels and Paul's letters widely recognized by 2nd century. Other books (Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, Jude, Revelation) took longer. Canon lists varied until councils in the 4th century (Athanasius's 39th Festal Letter, AD 367, lists our 27 books).

## Criteria for Inclusion

**1. Apostolic authorship or connection**
Written by an apostle or close associate (Mark with Peter, Luke with Paul).

**2. Widespread use**
Churches across regions recognized and used the book.

**3. Orthodoxy**
Teaching aligned with apostolic faith.

**4. Inspiration**
Recognized as Spirit-inspired.

These criteria are post-hoc—used to explain why certain books were accepted, not applied beforehand to decide.

## Differences in Canons

**Protestant:** 66 books (39 OT + 27 NT)
**Catholic:** 73 books (adds Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books)
**Orthodox:** Even more books

Who's right? Each tradition claims theirs is the true canon.

## The Hebrew Process

Canon wasn't decreed top-down. It emerged bottom-up from community use.

These are the books Israel found life-giving, read in worship, passed to children. Over time, consensus emerged: These are our Scriptures.

**Process:**
1. Books used in worship/teaching
2. Community recognizes God's voice in them
3. Gradual consensus forms
4. Canon reflects what the community received as authoritative

Not "Which books meet our criteria?" but "Which books has God given us?"

## Open or Closed?

**Protestant view:** Canon is closed. No new books can be added. Revelation ended with the apostles.

**Some traditions:** Canon can expand (Latter-day Saints add Book of Mormon).

**Hebrew model:** Canon is functionally closed (we're not adding to Torah), but interpretation is ongoing. The text is fixed; the meaning unfolds.

## Authority: The Books or the Community?

**Protestant:** The books have inherent authority. The church recognized what was already authoritative.

**Catholic:** The church's recognition gives authority. Without the church, there's no canon.

**Tension:** If the church determined the canon, can't the church change it? If the books are inherently authoritative, how did we know which ones?

**Hebrew answer:** Both/and. The books testify to God's acts. The community recognizes God's voice. Authority is relational—God speaks through these texts to this community.

Perhaps canon isn't a problem to solve but a gift to receive.
