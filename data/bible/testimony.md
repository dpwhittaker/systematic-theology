Is the Bible a [systematic theology](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') textbook, or a collection of [testimonies](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew') to what God has done?

**Greek approach:** Scripture contains doctrinal propositions. Extract them, systematize them.

**Hebrew approach:** Scripture is *witness*—people testifying to encounters with the living God. We don't extract doctrine; we hear their testimony and encounter God ourselves.

The difference: Information vs. invitation.

# Testimony, Not System

The Bible is not a systematic theology textbook. It doesn't have chapters on "The Doctrine of God," "The Doctrine of Sin," "The Doctrine of Salvation."

It tells stories. It records speeches. It preserves prayers, songs, prophecies, letters. It's messy, diverse, narrative.

**Why?** Because Scripture is **testimony**—witness to what God has done and who He is.

## What Is Testimony?

**Testimony = Personal witness to what you've experienced.**

In a courtroom, a witness testifies: "This is what I saw. This is what happened."

They don't give abstract principles. They narrate events. They speak from personal experience.

**Scripture works this way:**

**"We were slaves in Egypt, and the LORD brought us out with a mighty hand"** (Deuteronomy 6:21).

Not: "God possesses the attribute of deliverance."
But: "He delivered *us*. We saw it. We were there."

**"That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands... we proclaim also to you"** (1 John 1:1-3).

Not: "The Logos possesses dual natures."
But: "We touched Him. We heard Him. We're telling you what we experienced."

Testimony is first-person, historical, particular. Not third-person, timeless, universal.

## The Structure of Testimony

**1. "This happened"**
Narrative. Event. Not principle, but occurrence.

**Example:** Exodus. God brought Israel out of Egypt. This is history, testified to by participants and their descendants.

**2. "This is what it means"**
Interpretation. What does this event reveal about God?

**Example:** "The LORD is a warrior" (Exodus 15:3). The event (drowning Pharaoh's army) reveals God's character (He fights for His people).

**3. "Therefore, respond this way"**
Application. How should we live in light of this?

**Example:** "You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 23:9). Because God delivered you from oppression, don't oppress others.

**Structure: Event → Interpretation → Response.**

This is testimony's shape. Not: Abstract principle → Logical deduction → Application.

## Biblical Examples of Testimony

**Psalms:**
Personal testimony of encountering God.

"I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry" (Psalm 40:1).

This isn't theology *about* God. It's testimony *to* God's action. "This is what He did for me."

**Prophets:**
"The word of the LORD came to me..." (Jeremiah 1:4, etc.)

The prophet testifies to what God said, what God showed, what God commanded. First-person encounter.

**Gospels:**
"We have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father" (John 1:14).

John testifies to what he saw—Jesus. Not systematic Christology, but witness: "I saw Him."

**Acts:**
"This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses" (Acts 2:32).

The apostles' message is testimony: "We saw Him alive. We're witnesses."

## Testimony vs. Proposition

**Propositional theology:**
- God is omniscient (timeless truth)
- God is love (universal principle)
- Christ died for sins (doctrinal statement)

**Testimonial Scripture:**
- "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you" (Jeremiah 1:5—God's particular knowledge of Jeremiah)
- "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son" (John 3:16—God's specific act)
- "Christ died for our sins" (1 Corinthians 15:3—historical event testified to)

The propositions are derived from the testimony. But Scripture gives us testimony *first*.

**The Greek move:** Extract the propositions, systematize them, build doctrine.

**The Hebrew emphasis:** Receive the testimony, encounter the God testified to, respond in faith.

## The Problem with Extracting Propositions

When we reduce testimony to propositions, we lose:

**1. The particularity**
"God loves" (abstract) loses the scandal of "God loved *Jacob* and not Esau" (Romans 9:13, quoting Malachi 1:2-3).

**2. The narrative**
"God is sovereign" (proposition) flattens "Pharaoh hardened his heart, and God hardened Pharaoh's heart, and God judged Pharaoh" (Exodus 7-14—paradox in story form).

**3. The personal dimension**
"God is faithful" (doctrine) loses "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness" (Exodus 34:6—God's self-disclosure to Moses).

**4. The invitation**
Propositions can be believed without encounter. Testimony invites: "Come and see" (John 1:46). Experience this for yourself.

## Scripture Doesn't Systematize Itself

Notice: The Bible never gives us systematic theology.

**It doesn't define the "Trinity."** It shows Father, Son, Spirit of God relating. We systematize it later with Greek categories (ousia, hypostasis, "person").

**It doesn't define the atonement.** It uses multiple metaphors—ransom, sacrifice, reconciliation, victory. We build theories (substitution, Christus Victor, moral influence).

**It doesn't resolve sovereignty and free will.** It presents both (God ordains, humans choose) without explaining how they fit together.

Why?

**Possible answer:** Because Scripture's purpose isn't to provide a systematic theology textbook. It's to testify to God's acts and character, inviting us into relationship.

Theology is our attempt to make sense of the testimony. But the testimony comes first—and it resists full systematization.

## Second-Hand Testimony vs. First-Hand Encounter

**Second-hand:** I tell you what God did for someone else. You believe my testimony.

**First-hand:** You encounter God yourself. Now you testify.

**Scripture is both:**
- It testifies to what God did (Israel's deliverance, Christ's resurrection)
- It invites you to encounter God yourself (believe and be saved, receive the Spirit)

**The danger of propositional theology:** It can stay second-hand. You master the doctrines without encountering God.

**The power of testimonial Scripture:** It pushes you toward first-hand encounter. "Taste and see that the LORD is good" (Psalm 34:8).

## Living in the Story

If Scripture is testimony to God's acts, then reading it means **entering the story**.

Not standing outside, analyzing. But placing yourself within the narrative.

**"In every generation, each person should see themselves as if they personally came out of Egypt"** (Passover Haggadah).

Not "our ancestors came out." *We* came out. The past event is our present identity.

**Christian parallel:** Baptism unites us to Christ's death and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4). We participate in the event testified to.

The testimony becomes our testimony. We enter the story.

## The Hebrew Approach to Scripture

If Scripture is testimony:

**We read it asking:**
- What is God doing here?
- What does this reveal about His character?
- How do I respond to this God?

**Not:**
- What doctrinal proposition can I extract?
- How does this fit my systematic theology?
- What universal principle does this teach?

**We expect:**
- Narrative, not just doctrine
- Particularity, not just universals
- Invitation to encounter, not just information

**We respond:**
- With faith (trusting the God testified to)
- With obedience (living in light of what He's done)
- With our own testimony (telling what God has done for us)

## The Canon as Testimony Collection

The Bible is a collection of testimonies from different people, different times, different contexts—all witnessing to the one God.

**Diverse voices:**
- Moses, the prophets, the psalmists
- Matthew, Mark, Luke, John (four Gospels, four perspectives)
- Paul, Peter, James, Jude (different emphases)

**Why preserve diversity?** Because testimony is particular. Each witness sees from their angle. Together, they give a fuller picture than any single perspective.

**Greek theology wants to harmonize** (make them all say the same thing).
**Hebrew tradition preserves diversity** (each voice matters).

## Testimony and Authority

**How is testimony authoritative?**

**Not because it's systematically coherent** (it's not—Scripture has tensions).
**Not because it's inerrant propositions** (it's testimony, not encyclopedia).

**But because:**
1. It's God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16)—the Spirit inspired these witnesses
2. It testifies to real events (God truly acted)
3. It reveals God's character faithfully
4. It invites encounter with the living God

Authority isn't primarily in propositional accuracy. It's in **trustworthy witness to the God who acts**.

## The Invitation

Scripture doesn't end with "now you know these facts."

It ends with **invitation:**

"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).

"Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life" (Revelation 22:17).

Testimony invites response. Not intellectual assent to propositions, but personal trust in the God testified to.

Perhaps that's Scripture's ultimate purpose: Not to inform, but to invite. Not to give us doctrine to master, but to introduce us to a God to know.

Perhaps the Bible is less like a textbook and more like a courtroom—witnesses testifying, inviting you to believe their testimony and encounter the One they've seen.

Perhaps we're meant to join the testimony, adding our voices: "This is what the LORD has done for me."
