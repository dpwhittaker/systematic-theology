How do we understand Scripture?

**Greek methods:** Grammatical-historical (recover original meaning), systematic (fit verses into doctrinal system), allegorical (find hidden meanings).

**Hebrew methods:** [Midrash](#bible/midrash 'Hebrew') (wrestle with text), Peshat/Derash (plain and deeper meanings), *Lectio Divina* (meditative reading for encounter).

Extract propositions or encounter the living God?

# How to Read Scripture

Different methods reflect different assumptions about what Scripture is and what reading aims to accomplish.

## Greek Historical-Critical Method

**Goal:** Recover the original meaning—what the author intended for the original audience.

**Steps:**
1. Textual criticism (establish the original text)
2. Historical context (understand the setting)
3. Grammar and syntax (analyze the language)
4. Authorial intent (what did they mean to say?)
5. Application (how does that ancient meaning apply today?)

**Assumption:** Meaning is fixed in the past. Our job is to recover it.

**Strength:** Guards against reading our ideas into the text.
**Weakness:** Makes meaning dependent on scholarly expertise. Treats Scripture like any ancient document.

## Systematic/Doctrinal Method

**Goal:** Extract doctrinal truths and fit them into a coherent theological system.

**Process:**
1. Collect all verses on a topic
2. Harmonize them into a consistent doctrine
3. Resolve apparent contradictions
4. Build systematic theology

**Assumption:** Scripture teaches coherent doctrine. Our job is to systematize it.

**Strength:** Provides theological clarity and coherence.
**Weakness:** May flatten Scripture's diversity. Forces resolution of tensions the text leaves unresolved.

## Allegorical Method

**Goal:** Find hidden spiritual meanings beyond the literal sense.

**Example:** Origen and medieval exegesis saw four levels—literal, allegorical, moral, anagogical (future/heavenly).

**Problem:** Can make the text mean anything. Lost favor after the Reformation.

## Hebrew Methods

**1. Peshat and Derash**
*Peshat:* Plain meaning.
*Derash:* Interpretive meaning.

Both are valid. The plain sense doesn't exhaust meaning.

**2. Midrash**
Wrestling with the text—asking questions, filling gaps, exploring contradictions. See [Midrash](#bible/midrash 'Hebrew').

**3. PaRDeS (Four Levels)**
Simple, allegorical, interpretive, mystical—all simultaneously valid. See [Living Word](#bible/living-word 'Hebrew').

**4. Lectio Divina**
Christian monastic practice: Read slowly, meditate, pray, contemplate. Encounter God through the text, not just study it.

## The Question Behind the Method

**Greek question:** What does this text *mean*? (Information)

**Hebrew question:** What is God *saying to me* through this text? (Encounter)

Different questions. Different methods. Different goals.

Perhaps we need both—scholarship to understand the text, and meditation to encounter the God who speaks through it.
