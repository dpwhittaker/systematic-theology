How do we understand Scripture?

**Systematic methods:** Grammatical-historical (recover original meaning—foundational), systematic (fit verses into doctrinal system), allegorical (find hidden meanings).

**Hebrew methods:** [Midrash](#bible/midrash 'Hebrew') (wrestle with text), Peshat/Derash (plain and deeper meanings), *Lectio Divina* (meditative reading for encounter).

Extract propositions or encounter the living God?

# How to Read Scripture

Different methods reflect different assumptions about what Scripture is and what reading aims to accomplish.

## Grammatical-Historical Method

**Goal:** Recover the original meaning—what the author intended for the original audience.

**Steps:**
1. Textual criticism (establish the original text)
2. Historical context (understand the setting)
3. Grammar and syntax (analyze the language)
4. Authorial intent (what did they mean to say?)
5. Application (how does that ancient meaning apply today?)

**Assumption:** Meaning is fixed in the past. Our job is to recover it.

**Strength:** Guards against reading our ideas into the text.
**Potential pitfall:** May treat Scripture like any ancient document without recognizing divine authorship.

### Why Grammatical-Historical Is Foundational

Despite its limitations, this method deserves primacy for several reasons:

**1. Respects the human authors God chose:**
God didn't bypass human authors—He used them. Paul wrote to specific churches with specific problems. Moses wrote to Israel. Understanding what they meant honors God's choice to communicate through them.

**2. Prevents interpretive chaos:**
Without authorial intent as anchor, texts can mean anything. Medieval allegory proved this: one interpreter sees Abraham's two sons as law and grace, another sees them as body and soul. Which is right? Only the author's intent provides objective criteria.

**3. The NT authors modeled it:**
When NT writers cite the OT, they typically respect the original context:
- Matthew 2:15 ("Out of Egypt I called my son") recognizes Hosea's historical reference while seeing typological fulfillment
- Paul in Galatians 3:16 argues from the actual grammar of Genesis
- Hebrews interprets the Tabernacle by understanding what it actually was

**4. Jesus assumed it:**
"Have you not read...?" (Matthew 12:3, 19:4, 22:31). Jesus expected people to understand Scripture by reading it—its plain, grammatical, historical sense.

**5. It's the foundation, not the ceiling:**
Grammatical-historical interpretation establishes *what the text says*. Additional reflection (theological, devotional, applicational) builds on this foundation. Without the foundation, everything else floats unmoored.

The goal isn't to limit Scripture to academic dissection but to ensure our deeper readings are tethered to what God actually said through human authors.

## Systematic/Doctrinal Method

**Goal:** Extract doctrinal truths and fit them into a coherent theological system.

**Process:**
1. Collect all verses on a topic
2. Harmonize them into a consistent doctrine
3. Resolve apparent contradictions
4. Build systematic theology

**Assumption:** Scripture teaches coherent doctrine. Our job is to systematize it.

**Strength:** Provides theological clarity and coherence.
**Weakness:** May flatten Scripture's diversity. Forces resolution of tensions the text leaves unresolved.

## Allegorical Method

**Goal:** Find hidden spiritual meanings beyond the literal sense.

**Example:** Origen and medieval exegesis saw four levels—literal, allegorical, moral, anagogical (future/heavenly).

**Problem:** Can make the text mean anything. Lost favor after the Reformation.

## Hebrew Methods

**1. Peshat and Derash**
*Peshat:* Plain meaning.
*Derash:* Interpretive meaning.

Both are valid. The plain sense doesn't exhaust meaning.

**2. Midrash**
Wrestling with the text—asking questions, filling gaps, exploring contradictions. See [Midrash](#bible/midrash 'Hebrew').

**3. PaRDeS (Four Levels)**
Simple, allegorical, interpretive, mystical—all simultaneously valid. See [Living Word](#bible/living-word 'Hebrew').

**4. Lectio Divina**
Christian monastic practice: Read slowly, meditate, pray, contemplate. Encounter God through the text, not just study it.

## The Question Behind the Method

**Greek question:** What does this text *mean*? (Information)

**Hebrew question:** What is God *saying to me* through this text? (Encounter)

Different questions. Different methods. Different goals.

Perhaps we need both—scholarship to understand the text, and meditation to encounter the God who speaks through it.
