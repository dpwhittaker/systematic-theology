After the [Fall](#man/fall 'Hebrew'), can humans choose God?

**Greek debate:** Pelagius (yes), Augustine (no, will enslaved), Calvinism (total inability), Arminianism (prevenient grace enables choice). Centuries of philosophical arguments about freedom and determinism.

**Hebrew framework:** Not "Can we choose?" but "Will we return?" Covenant relationship assumes both God's initiative and human response. Not philosophical capacity, but relational dynamic.

The question may reveal Greek assumptions.

# Free Will: Can We Choose God?

After the Fall, are humans free to choose God? Or is the will so damaged by sin that we cannot choose good without God's grace?

This has been one of Christianity's most divisive questions. Pelagius vs. Augustine. Calvinism vs. Arminianism. Molinism. Compatibilism. Centuries of debate.

## The Greek Philosophical Framework

**The question assumes Greek categories:**
- Free will as a **capacity** or **power** humans possess (or don't)
- Choice as an **act of the will** that is either free or determined
- Grace as something that either **enables** choice or **overrides** choice

Greek philosophy debated freedom vs. determinism long before Christianity. Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans—all asked: Are we free agents, or are our actions determined by fate/nature/the gods?

Christianity inherited this debate and applied it to sin and salvation.

## Pelagius: Full Free Will

**Pelagius (4th-5th century, British monk):**

**Claim:**
- Humans have full free will after the Fall
- We can choose to obey God or not
- Adam's sin affected only Adam (no inherited guilt, no corrupted nature)
- We sin by imitating Adam's example, not by inheriting his guilt

**Grace is:**
- God's creation of humans with free will
- God's Law showing us what to do
- Jesus' example of how to live

**We don't need special grace to choose God.** We just need to use the free will God gave us.

**Result:** Salvation depends on human choice and effort. We save ourselves by choosing rightly.

**Condemned as heresy** by the Council of Carthage (418) and Council of Ephesus (431).

**Why?**
- Minimizes the depth of sin's damage
- Makes grace unnecessary (just helpful)
- Makes salvation a human achievement (not gift)
- Contradicts Paul: "No one seeks for God" (Romans 3:11)

## Augustine: Will Enslaved to Sin

**Augustine (responding to Pelagius):**

**Before the Fall:**
- Adam could not sin (*posse non peccare*)
- Free will intact, able to choose good

**After the Fall:**
- Humans **cannot not sin** (*non posse non peccare*)
- Will is enslaved to sin
- We can choose between various sins, but we cannot choose to love God and obey Him without grace

Augustine's [four-state framework](#man/fall#augustine-four-states 'Greek') shows how [original sin](#man/fall#original-sin 'Greek') corrupted the will.

**Grace is necessary:**
- To open blind eyes (we don't even see our need)
- To free the enslaved will (we can't choose God on our own)
- To work in us both "to will and to work" (Philippians 2:13)

**Order of salvation:**
1. God's grace comes first (prevenient)
2. God opens eyes and frees will
3. We respond in faith (enabled by grace)

**But even our response is a gift:** "By grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8).

**Result:** Salvation is entirely God's work. We contribute nothing. Faith itself is a gift.

## The Calvinist Position: Total Inability

**John Calvin (16th century) develops Augustine's view:**

### Total Depravity (One of the "Five Points of Calvinism")

The [Fall](#man/fall 'Hebrew') affected **every part** of human nature:
- Mind: Cannot understand spiritual truth (1 Corinthians 2:14)
- Heart: Stone, not flesh (Ezekiel 36:26)
- Will: Enslaved to sin (John 8:34, Romans 6:20)

**"Total" doesn't mean maximally evil, but comprehensively corrupted.** We can do good things (relatively), but we cannot choose God or please Him without grace.

### Irresistible Grace

When God chooses to save someone, His grace is **effectual** (it accomplishes its purpose):
1. God regenerates the person (makes them spiritually alive)
2. The regenerated person believes (enabled by new nature)
3. Faith is the result of regeneration, not the cause

**The will is not violated:** God changes our desires so that we freely (willingly) choose Him. But He ensures we choose Him.

**Scriptural support:**
- Ezekiel 36:26—"I will remove the heart of stone... and give you a heart of flesh."
- John 6:44—"No one can come to me unless the Father draws him."
- Acts 13:48—"As many as were appointed to eternal life believed."

### Unconditional Election

God chose whom to save before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4-5), not based on foreseen faith or works, but purely by His sovereign choice.

**Result:** Our salvation depends entirely on God's will, not ours. This is comforting (no uncertainty—if God chose you, you're secure) and troubling (what about those He didn't choose?).

## The Arminian Position: Prevenient Grace

**Jacobus Arminius (16th-17th century) and his followers:**

**Agreement with Augustine:**
- The Fall corrupted human nature
- Without grace, we cannot choose God
- Grace is necessary for salvation

**Difference:**
- God gives **prevenient grace** to everyone (or at least to all who hear the gospel)
- This grace restores enough ability that people can respond in faith
- But grace can be **resisted**

**Order of salvation:**
1. God gives prevenient grace to all
2. Grace enables (but doesn't force) response
3. People freely choose to accept or reject God
4. God regenerates those who believe

**Faith precedes regeneration** (opposite of Calvinism).

**Scriptural support:**
- John 3:16—"Whoever believes" (implies real choice)
- 1 Timothy 2:4—"God desires all people to be saved"
- 2 Peter 3:9—"Not wishing that any should perish"

**Result:** Salvation depends on God's grace (providing ability) and human response (choosing to believe). This preserves human responsibility but raises the question: If grace is the same for all, why do some believe and others don't?

**Arminian answer:** The mystery of human choice. God respects our freedom to accept or reject Him.

## Compatibilism vs. Libertarian Free Will

**The philosophical debate beneath the theological one:**

### Libertarian Free Will

**Definition:** A choice is free only if you could have chosen otherwise, with nothing determining your choice.

**Held by:** Arminians, Molinists, Eastern Orthodox

**Implication:** God's sovereignty is self-limited. He gives space for genuine human freedom, even though it introduces unpredictability.

### Compatibilism (Soft Determinism)

**Definition:** Free will is compatible with determinism. A choice is free if it flows from your desires, even if your desires are caused by something else (including God).

**Held by:** Calvinists, many Augustinians

**Implication:** God determines all things (including human choices) without violating human freedom, because we act according to our desires. God shapes our desires so that we freely (willingly) do what He ordained.

**Problem:** Is this really freedom? If God causes my desires, and my desires cause my choices, how am I free?

**Response:** You're free because you're not coerced. You do what you want. The fact that God ensures you want what He ordained doesn't make you unfree—it makes you genuinely want what's good.

## Hebrew Framework: The Wrong Question?

Hebrew thought doesn't frame the issue as "Do we have free will?"

**The question is relational, not philosophical:**
- Not: "Can I choose?"
- But: "Will I return?"

### Covenant Structure Assumes Both

**God's initiative:**
- God chose Israel (Deuteronomy 7:6-8)
- Not because they were great, but because He loved them
- Election is God's sovereign choice

**Human response:**
- "Choose this day whom you will serve" (Joshua 24:15)
- "If you will indeed obey my voice..." (Exodus 19:5)
- Covenant demands response, obedience, love

**Both are held together without resolution:**
- God elects
- Humans choose
- Both are true

### Deuteronomy 30:11-14

"For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off... The word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart, **so that you can do it**."

God's command assumes human ability to respond. Yet the same book says Israel will fail (Deuteronomy 31:16-18) and God will have to circumcise their hearts (Deuteronomy 30:6).

**Hebrew tension:** You can do it / You won't do it without God's help.

### Rabbinic Paradox: "All Is Foreseen, Yet Freedom Is Given"

*Mishnah, Avot 3:15:* "All is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given."

Rabbi Akiva holds both: God's foreknowledge and human freedom. No attempt to resolve the tension philosophically.

*Talmud, Berachot 33b:* "Everything is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven."

God controls all, but human response (fear/reverence of God) is genuinely ours.

**Eilu v'eilu:** These and these are the words of the living God. The contradictions reveal depth, not error.

### New Testament: Both/And

**God's sovereignty in salvation:**
- John 6:44—"No one can come to me unless the Father draws him."
- John 15:16—"You did not choose me, but I chose you."
- Ephesians 1:4—"He chose us in him before the foundation of the world."
- Romans 9:16—"It depends not on human will or exertion, but on God."

**Human responsibility to respond:**
- John 3:16—"Whoever believes in him shall not perish."
- Acts 2:38—"Repent and be baptized."
- Romans 10:9—"If you confess with your mouth... you will be saved."
- Revelation 22:17—"Let the one who desires take the water of life freely."

**Both are affirmed. No attempt to harmonize them into a philosophical system.**

### Not a Capacity, But a Relationship

Hebrew thought doesn't ask: Do you have the capacity (free will) to choose God?

It asks: Will you **return** to God? Will you **trust** Him? Will you **walk** with Him?

**The call is relational:**
- Return to Me (Malachi 3:7)
- Seek the LORD while He may be found (Isaiah 55:6)
- Come to Me, all who are weary (Matthew 11:28)

**These invitations assume real human response.** But they're issued by a God who also says: I have called you, I have chosen you, I will draw you.

**The tension is not resolved.** It's held.

## Practical Implications

**1. Should we evangelize?**

**Hyper-Calvinist problem:** If God has already chosen who will be saved, why evangelize? They'll be saved anyway.

**Biblical response:** God ordains both the end (salvation) and the means (preaching). We evangelize because God commands it and uses it.

**Arminian clarity:** We evangelize because people need to hear and respond. Their choice matters.

**2. Can we lose salvation?**

**Calvinist:** No. If God chose you, He'll keep you. "Perseverance of the saints."

**Arminian:** Yes. Grace can be resisted at any point, even after initial faith.

**Scriptural tension:**
- John 10:28—"No one will snatch them out of my hand."
- Hebrews 6:4-6—"It is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have fallen away."

Both verses are in Scripture. Different frameworks emphasize different verses.

**3. Are we responsible for our sin?**

**Calvinist affirms:** Yes. We sin freely (according to our desires), so we're responsible, even though God ordained it.

**Objection:** How can I be responsible for what God predetermined?

**Arminian affirms:** Yes. We genuinely choose to sin. God doesn't cause sin, though He permits it.

**Objection:** If God permits it while able to prevent it, how is He not responsible?

**Both struggle with theodicy** (the problem of evil). Neither resolves it fully.

**4. Is assurance possible?**

**Calvinist:** Yes. If you have genuine faith, you're elect and secure.

**Arminian:** Conditional. You can be assured now, but you might fall away later.

**Hebrew framework:** Assurance is relational. "I know whom I have believed" (2 Timothy 1:12). Not: I know that I know. But: I know Him.

## The Limits of Greek Categories

**The entire debate assumes:**
- Free will is a **thing** you have or don't have
- Choice is either **free** (uncaused) or **determined** (caused)
- God's sovereignty and human freedom are **competing** forces

**But what if:**
- Freedom is not a capacity, but a relational reality?
- God's sovereignty doesn't compete with human agency but enables it?
- The question "Can we choose God?" presumes a framework Scripture doesn't use?

**Hebrew thought doesn't resolve the paradox philosophically.** It holds divine sovereignty and human responsibility in tension because both are testified to in Scripture.

**Maybe the question isn't:** Can I choose God?

**But:** Will I respond to the God who has already chosen me?

And maybe the fact that we ask the first question (philosophical) instead of the second (relational) shows how deeply Greek categories have shaped us.

Perhaps the resolution is not a system, but a Person. Not an explanation, but an encounter. Perhaps we're asking the wrong question.
