[Mankind](#man/man 'Parent')

Genesis 3: Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit. Everything breaks.

**Greek view:** The Fall as metaphysical corruption. Human [nature](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') changed from good to evil. Original sin inherited like a disease.

**Hebrew view:** The Fall as relational rupture. Humans chose autonomy over trust. Four relationships broken: with [God](#god/acts 'Hebrew'), each other, creation, self.

Not change of essence, but break in covenant.

# What Happened in the Garden?

Genesis 3 is the hinge of human history. Everything before: very good. Everything after: broken.

But *how* did the Fall work? What changed?

## Greek Interpretation: Nature Changed {#augustine-four-states}

**Augustine's doctrine (influenced by Platonism):**

Before the Fall:
- Humans could not sin (*posse non peccare*)
- Free will intact, nature good

After the Fall:
- Humans cannot not sin (*non posse non peccare*)
- Nature corrupted, will enslaved to sin

After Regeneration (in this life):
- Humans can not sin (*posse non peccare*)
- Grace enables obedience, but sin remains possible

In Glory (resurrection):
- Humans cannot sin (*non posse peccare*)
- Will perfected, sin impossible

**The image:** Human nature itself was damaged. Like a machine that got a defective part—now it can't work rightly.

**Original sin:** Not just Adam's guilt, but corrupted nature passed to all descendants. We're born sinful. {#original-sin}

**Total depravity:** Every part of human nature (mind, will, affections) is corrupted. We can't choose good without God's grace.

**Problem:** This makes sin metaphysical (about our nature/essence) rather than moral (about our choices). It treats sin like a disease we inherited, not rebellion we choose.

## Hebrew Interpretation: Relationship Broken

**Genesis 3 is about broken trust and autonomy.**

**The temptation:** "You will be like God, knowing good and evil" (Genesis 3:5).

Not: "Your nature will change."
But: "You can decide for yourselves what's good and evil. You don't need God to tell you."

**The sin:** Choosing autonomy over dependence, self-rule over God's rule.

**The result:** Four relationships fractured:

**1. With God**
"They hid from the LORD God" (Genesis 3:8). Fear replaces intimacy.

**2. With each other**
"The woman you gave me..." (Genesis 3:12). Blame, shame, domination (Genesis 3:16).

**3. With creation**
"Cursed is the ground because of you" (Genesis 3:17). Toil, thorns, alienation from the earth.

**4. With self**
"I was afraid, because I was naked" (Genesis 3:10). Shame, self-alienation.

**The Fall is relational, not metaphysical.** It's a break in covenant, not a change in nature.

## Sin as Exile

After the Fall, humans are exiled from the garden (Genesis 3:23-24). Cherubim guard the way back.

**This is covenant pattern:**
- Relationship with God: expelled from His presence
- Access to life (tree of life): cut off

Sin is exile from God's presence. The rest of Scripture is the story of return—God coming to dwell with His people again (Tabernacle, Temple, Incarnation, Spirit indwelling, New Jerusalem).

## Death Enters

"In the day you eat of it you shall surely die" (Genesis 2:17).

They ate. Did they die? Not physically—Adam lived 930 years (Genesis 5:5).

**But they died relationally:** Separated from God, whose presence is life.

**And they became mortal:** "Dust you are, and to dust you shall return" (Genesis 3:19).

Death isn't just biological cessation—it's separation from the source of life.

## Original Sin: Inherited Guilt or Pattern? {#inherited-guilt-or-pattern}

**Western (Augustine/Catholic/Protestant) view:**
Adam's sin is imputed to all. We're guilty from birth. Infant baptism washes away original sin's guilt.

**Mechanism:**
- **Federal headship:** Adam represented all humanity. His sin is counted as ours.
- **Seminal headship:** We were "in Adam" when he sinned (in his seed). Therefore we sinned in him.

**Basis:** Romans 5:12—"sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned."

**Result:** Every human (except Jesus) is born:
1. Guilty of Adam's sin
2. With corrupted nature that cannot not sin
3. Deserving of death and condemnation

**Eastern Orthodox view:**
We inherit mortality and a sinful environment, not guilt. We're not guilty for Adam's sin, but we're born into a world damaged by sin, and we choose to sin.

**Basis:** Same verse, but "all sinned" means we each sin individually, not that Adam's sin is counted as ours.

**Jewish view (Rabbinic tradition):**
Each person dies for their own sin, not Adam's. We're born with capacity for sin (yetzer hara) and good (yetzer tov), but not guilty until we sin.

**Hebrew framework:**
Adam's story is *everyone's* story. We all choose autonomy. We all break covenant. The pattern repeats.

Not: We're guilty because Adam sinned.
But: We're sinners because we sin—following the pattern Adam established.

**Psalm 51:5:** "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me."

Not necessarily: "I inherited guilt from conception."
But: "I've been sinful from the start. Sin is my story from the beginning."

## Can We Still Choose Good?

**Calvinist view:** Total depravity means we can't choose God without irresistible grace.

**Arminian view:** Prevenient grace enables everyone to choose God, though we're still sinful.

**Hebrew framework:** Chosenness vs. choice isn't the question. The question is: Will you return to covenant? Will you trust God again?

The Fall didn't erase free will (we still choose). It broke our orientation (we choose self over God).

Redemption isn't about re-enabling will. It's about renewed relationship—God drawing us back, us responding in trust.

## Restoration

The Fall is the problem. The Gospel is the solution.

**Greek answer:** Christ fixes our corrupted nature. Regeneration heals the metaphysical damage.

**Hebrew answer:** Christ restores relationship. Reconciliation brings us back to God. The exile ends.

**Both are true.** But the Hebrew framework keeps the focus relational—sin as broken covenant, salvation as restored relationship.

Perhaps the Fall isn't primarily about a nature-change, but about a trust-break. Perhaps we're not diseased patients needing cure, but prodigal children needing welcome home.
