*Humanity* - created in [God's image](#man/image 'Drill'), fallen into [sin](#man/fall 'Drill').

**Greek approach:** Define human [nature](#intro/philosophy 'Greek').
- [Body and Soul](#man/body-soul 'Greek'): Are we divided? Dualism or unity?
- [Original Sin](#man/original-sin 'Greek'): Inherited guilt or corrupted nature?
- [Free Will](#man/free-will 'Greek'): Can we choose good after the Fall?

**Hebrew approach:** *Adam* (אדם) from *adamah* (אדמה) - earth-creature, [relational](#intro/relation 'Hebrew') being.
- [Image of God](#man/image 'Hebrew'): Vocation and relationship, not essence or capacity.
- [The Fall](#man/fall 'Hebrew'): Broken relationship with God, each other, creation.
- [Living Soul](#man/nephesh 'Hebrew'): *Nephesh chayyah* - whole person, not divided parts.

Can we be both [rational souls](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') and [dust given breath](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew')?
