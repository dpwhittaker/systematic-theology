Why do all humans sin? Because Adam sinned first?

**Greek doctrine (Augustine):** Adam's sin is **imputed** to all descendants. We inherit guilt and corrupted nature. Born sinful, unable not to sin.

**Hebrew pattern:** Adam's story is *everyone's* story. We're not guilty *for* Adam's sin, but we follow his pattern—choosing autonomy, breaking covenant. We sin because we're sinners (not vice versa).

Inherited guilt or repeated pattern?

# Original Sin: Born Guilty?

Why does every human sin? No exceptions (except Jesus). What explains universal human sinfulness?

## Greek Doctrine: Inherited Corruption

**Augustine's formulation** (4th-5th century, influenced by his Manichaean background and debates with Pelagius):

**Before the Fall:**
- Adam could not sin (*posse non peccare*)
- Free will intact, human nature good
- Possibility of obedience

**After the Fall:**
- Humans **cannot not sin** (*non posse non peccare*)
- Will enslaved to sin, nature corrupted
- Unable to choose good without God's grace

### The Mechanism: How Sin Spreads

**Romans 5:12:** "Sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned."

**Augustine's interpretation:**
- Adam's sin is **imputed** (legally credited) to all descendants
- We inherit both **guilt** and **corrupted nature**
- We're born sinful, before we commit any actual sins

**Federal headship:** Adam represented all humanity. His sin is counted as ours.

**Seminal headship:** We were "in Adam" when he sinned (we were in his seed). Therefore we sinned in him.

**Result:** Every human (except Jesus) is born:
1. Guilty of Adam's sin
2. With corrupted nature that cannot not sin
3. Deserving of death and condemnation

### Total Depravity

**Reformed doctrine (Calvin, Westminster Confession):**

Original sin affects **every part** of human nature:
- Mind: darkened, cannot know God truly
- Will: enslaved to sin, cannot choose good
- Affections: disordered, love wrong things
- Body: mortal, subject to decay

"Total" doesn't mean utterly evil (humans can do relatively good things). It means **comprehensively affected**—no part of us is untouched by sin.

**Practical effect:** We cannot save ourselves. We cannot even choose God without His grace enabling us (see [Free Will](#man/free-will 'Greek')).

### Infant Baptism

**Catholic/Lutheran view:**
- Infants are born with original sin's guilt
- Baptism washes away original sin
- If unbaptized infants die, they may go to limbo (Catholic) or be damned (some Protestants)

**Reformed view:**
- Baptism is a sign of covenant inclusion
- Elect infants are saved by God's grace without baptism
- But all are born guilty and corrupted by Adam's sin

### Problem: Is This Just?

If we're guilty for Adam's sin before we've done anything, is that fair?

**Objection (Pelagius, 5th century):** Each person sins by their own choice. We're not born guilty. Adam's sin affected only Adam.

**Augustine's response:** We're guilty because we were represented by Adam. His sin is ours. Just as Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers (federalism works both ways).

**Objection (Ezekiel 18:20):** "The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father."

**Response:** This addresses personal guilt for personal sins. It doesn't address inherited sinful nature or corporate representation.

**The tension:** Greek categories of justice (individual guilt for individual acts) don't easily accommodate inherited guilt. Augustine's system creates logical problems:
- How can I be guilty for what Adam did?
- If I'm born unable to not sin, how am I responsible for sinning?
- If God holds me guilty for inherited sin, is He just?

## Hebrew Pattern: Adam's Story Is Everyone's Story

Hebrew thought emphasizes **corporate solidarity** and **pattern** rather than legal imputation.

### Romans 5:12 Revisited

"Sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men **because all sinned**."

**Eastern Orthodox interpretation:**
- We don't inherit Adam's **guilt**
- We inherit **mortality** and are born into a **sinful environment**
- Death spread to all because **all sinned** (each person individually)

**The pattern:**
- Adam chose autonomy over trust
- We all make the same choice
- Adam's sin opened the door; we walk through it

**Not:** We're guilty because Adam sinned.

**But:** We're sinners because we sin—following the pattern Adam established.

### Psalm 51:5: "In Sin Did My Mother Conceive Me"

**Augustine:** This proves we're born sinful, inheriting guilt from conception.

**Alternative reading:** David is acknowledging that sin has been his story from the beginning. He's been a sinner as long as he can remember. The point is comprehensiveness ("I've been sinful from the start"), not mechanism (how sin is transmitted).

### Corporate and Individual

Hebrew thought holds **both** simultaneously:
- We're individuals responsible for our own choices
- We're part of a corporate whole (family, nation, humanity)

**Example:** Achan's sin (Joshua 7)—his family suffered for his sin. Not because they inherited legal guilt, but because they were bound together.

**Example:** Exile—the whole nation exiled for corporate unfaithfulness, even though individuals varied in guilt.

This is **relational consequence**, not legal imputation. Our choices affect those connected to us.

### Death as Consequence, Not Punishment

Genesis 3:19: "To dust you shall return."

**Consequence of the [Fall](#man/fall 'Hebrew'):**
- Exile from God's presence (which is life)
- Mortality (cut off from the tree of life)
- Alienation from God, each other, creation

**We inherit the consequences:** We're born into a world broken by sin, separated from God, mortal.

But **guilt** is personal, attached to personal sin.

### Jewish View (Rabbinic Tradition)

**Mishnah and Talmud generally reject inherited guilt:**

*Talmud, Shabbat 55a:* "There is no death without sin, and no suffering without iniquity."

Each person dies for their own sin, not Adam's.

*Genesis Rabbah:* Adam's sin brought mortality into the world, but each person is responsible for their own sinfulness.

**Yetzer hara and yetzer tov:**
- Evil inclination (yetzer hara) and good inclination (yetzer tov)
- Both present in every person
- We're born with the capacity for sin, but not guilty until we sin

**Bar/Bat Mitzvah:** At age 12/13, children become responsible for their own sins. Before that, parents bear responsibility. This assumes children aren't born guilty.

## New Testament Nuances

### Paul's Argument in Romans 5

Paul's point: **Adam brought sin and death; Christ brings righteousness and life.**

**The parallel:**
- As sin came through one man (Adam), righteousness comes through one man (Christ)
- As death spread to all through Adam, life is offered to all through Christ

**Is Paul teaching inherited guilt or making a comparison?**

**Option 1 (Augustinian):** Paul teaches that Adam's sin is legally imputed to all, just as Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers.

**Option 2 (Pattern):** Paul is saying Adam set the pattern of sin-death, Christ set the pattern of righteousness-life. The parallel is **functional**, not **legal**.

Both readings are possible from the text.

### 1 Corinthians 15:22

"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive."

**"In Adam all die":**
- Option 1: We die because we're legally counted in Adam (federal headship)
- Option 2: We die because we're connected to Adam (solidarity in humanity)

**"In Christ all be made alive":**
- Parallel structure: as we're in Adam (humanity), so we can be in Christ (new humanity)

The emphasis is on **corporate identity**, not just legal imputation.

## Two Models

### Greek Legal Model

**Original sin as:**
- Inherited guilt (Adam's sin counted as ours)
- Corrupted nature (born unable to not sin)
- Total depravity (every part affected)

**Strengths:**
- Explains universal sinfulness
- Parallels justification (Christ's righteousness imputed)
- Takes human depravity seriously

**Weaknesses:**
- Raises justice questions (guilty for someone else's sin)
- Creates tension with individual responsibility (Ezekiel 18)
- Focuses on legal status rather than relational rupture

### Hebrew Relational Model

**Original sin as:**
- Inherited mortality and broken world
- Following Adam's pattern of autonomy
- Corporate solidarity in fallen humanity

**Strengths:**
- Maintains individual responsibility
- Explains universal sinfulness through pattern, not legal fiction
- Keeps focus on relationship (broken with God) rather than legal status

**Weaknesses:**
- Doesn't explain why *every* person sins (if we're born neutral)
- Less clear mechanism for sin's spread
- May underestimate the depth of human sinfulness

## Practical Implications

**1. Are infants guilty before God?**

**Augustinian:** Yes, born with inherited guilt. Need baptism.

**Hebrew framework:** No, born into broken world, but not personally guilty until they sin. God's grace covers those who die in infancy.

**2. Can we choose not to sin?**

**Augustinian:** No, not without grace. Will is enslaved.

**Hebrew framework:** We can choose, but we're shaped by the pattern. The question is: Will we return to God?

**3. Is human nature good or evil?**

**Augustinian:** Corrupted by the Fall. Every part affected.

**Hebrew framework:** Created good, but we choose to follow the pattern of autonomy. Not changed in essence, but oriented away from God.

**4. What does salvation restore?**

**Augustinian:** Fixes corrupted nature, imputes righteousness, frees the will.

**Hebrew framework:** Restores relationship with God, breaks the pattern of autonomy, brings us into new covenant.

## The Unanswered Question

Both frameworks acknowledge: **Everyone sins. No exceptions.**

**Why?**

**Greek answer:** We inherited Adam's guilt and corrupted nature.

**Hebrew answer:** We follow Adam's pattern. We're born into a broken world, shaped by sin from the beginning, and we choose autonomy just like Adam did.

**Either way, the result is the same:** We're sinners, separated from God, in need of redemption.

Perhaps the question isn't *how* sin is transmitted (legal imputation vs. pattern), but *what* God does about it. Both Greek and Hebrew frameworks agree: **We cannot save ourselves. God must act.**

And He did. Not by explaining the mechanism of sin's spread, but by taking it upon Himself. Perhaps that's the only resolution that matters.
