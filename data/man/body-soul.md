Are humans one unified being, or two parts joined together?

**Greek dualism:** Body and soul are distinct substances. Soul = immaterial, immortal, rational (the real you). Body = material, mortal, temporary vessel.

**Hebrew unity:** No division into parts. *Basar* (flesh), *nephesh* (life/self), *ruach* (breath/spirit), *leb* (heart) are aspects of one whole person, not separate components.

Not: Do we have souls? But: Are we souls *with* bodies, or embodied souls?

# Body and Soul: One or Two?

Plato asked: What am I, essentially? His answer shaped Christian theology for centuries.

## Greek Dualism: Two Substances

**Plato's anthropology:**
- Humans are **souls** (immaterial, eternal, rational)
- Souls inhabit **bodies** (material, mortal, physical prison)
- At death, the soul departs and continues existing
- The body is temporary; the soul is the real person

**Implications:**
- Salvation is primarily about the soul's destiny (heaven or hell)
- Physical life is less important than spiritual life
- Resurrection adds a body back to the already-surviving soul
- Asceticism: discipline the body to free the soul

**Christian adoption:**
This entered Christian theology through the early church fathers (many trained in Greek philosophy):

**Augustine** (influenced by Neoplatonism): The soul is the substance of the person. The body is animated by the soul but not essential to personhood.

**Thomas Aquinas** (influenced by Aristotle): Soul is the "form" of the body. More integrated than Plato, but still: the rational soul is what makes humans human.

**Descartes**: "I think, therefore I am." The thinking self (soul/mind) is distinct from the body. Radical dualism: body is a machine, mind is immaterial.

## Problems with Dualism

**1. Not in Genesis**

Genesis 2:7: "The LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a [nephesh chayyah](#man/nephesh 'Hebrew')."

The text doesn't say God created a body and inserted a soul. Dust + breath = living being. The whole person *is* the nephesh, not *has* a nephesh.

**2. Devalues the Body**

If the soul is the real you and the body is just temporary housing:
- Physical suffering matters less (it's "just" the body)
- Sexual ethics become about restraining the body's appetites
- Heaven is escape from bodily existence
- Resurrection seems unnecessary (souls are already "saved")

But Scripture says:
- Bodies will be **resurrected** (1 Corinthians 15)
- God will make **new heavens and new earth** (Revelation 21)
- Jesus rose **bodily** (John 20:27—"Put your finger here; see my hands")

Why resurrection if souls are immortal and heaven is the goal?

**3. Creates the Mind-Body Problem**

If soul and body are different substances (immaterial vs. material), how do they interact?

- How does my immaterial decision (soul) move my material arm (body)?
- How does brain damage (body) affect personality and memory (soul)?

Philosophers have struggled with this for centuries. Dualism creates a problem it can't solve.

## Hebrew Unity: One Whole Person

Hebrew anthropology doesn't divide humans into parts.

**Key terms:**
- *Basar* (בָּשָׂר) - flesh, body
- *Nephesh* (נֶפֶשׁ) - life, self, person (see [Nephesh](#man/nephesh 'Hebrew'))
- *Ruach* (רוּחַ) - breath, spirit, wind
- *Leb* (לֵב) - heart (seat of mind, will, emotions)

These aren't components assembled to make a person. They're **aspects** of the whole person.

**Example:** Deuteronomy 6:5—"You shall love the LORD your God with all your *heart* and with all your *soul* and with all your *might*."

Not three separate parts. Three ways of saying: Love God with your **whole being**—everything you are.

**Death in Hebrew thought:**

Ecclesiastes 12:7: "The dust returns to the earth as it was, and the *ruach* returns to God who gave it."

The breath returns to God. The body returns to dust. The person? **Gone.** Dead.

Not: The soul lives on without the body.

But: The whole person dies. Death is the end of life, not the liberation of the soul.

**Sheol** (the grave, the pit) is where the dead go—shadowy, diminished existence. Not the soul living happily in heaven, but the whole person in the realm of death.

## New Testament: Continuity with Hebrew View

**Paul's anthropology:**

1 Corinthians 15:17-18: "If Christ has not been raised... those who have fallen asleep in Christ have **perished**."

If souls are immortal and survive death, how have they "perished"? They'd be fine in heaven, waiting for resurrection.

But Paul's logic assumes: No resurrection = truly dead, gone, perished.

**Why?** Because humans are **embodied** beings. Death ends the person. Resurrection is essential to restore life.

**Resurrection is not optional:**

1 Corinthians 15:12-19: Paul's entire argument assumes resurrection is necessary. Without it, faith is futile, we're still in our sins, the dead are lost.

If the immortal soul survives and goes to heaven, why is resurrection so critical? Only if humans are whole persons (not souls in bodies) does resurrection matter this much.

## Intermediate State: Where Are the Dead?

If humans are unified persons and death ends life, what happens between death and resurrection?

**Greek answer:** The soul goes to heaven or hell. The body is buried. At resurrection, body reunites with soul.

**Hebrew tension:** The dead are in Sheol/Hades—realm of the dead. Not fully alive, but not annihilated either.

**New Testament hints:**
- Philippians 1:23—"to depart and be with Christ"
- Luke 23:43—"today you will be with me in Paradise"
- 2 Corinthians 5:8—"away from the body and at home with the Lord"

These suggest conscious existence after death. But they don't describe it as the soul's natural immortality—they describe it as being "with Christ," a relational state.

**Possibilities:**

**1. Soul-sleep:** The dead are unconscious until resurrection (some Reformers held this).

**2. Incomplete existence:** The dead are conscious but not fully alive—awaiting resurrection to be whole persons again.

**3. Temporary disembodiment:** An abnormal state that will be corrected at resurrection. Not the soul's natural destiny, but an intermediate condition.

The New Testament doesn't systematize this. It focuses on the hope: resurrection to embodied life in the new creation.

## Implications

**1. Bodies Matter**

Not shells to escape, but integral to who we are. Caring for bodies—feeding the hungry, healing the sick, seeking justice—is spiritual work.

**2. Resurrection is Essential**

Not an optional add-on to already-saved souls, but the restoration of whole persons. The hope of Christianity is not "going to heaven when you die" but "resurrection to eternal embodied life."

**3. This World Matters**

If salvation is souls escaping to heaven, earth is just a waiting room. If God will redeem all creation (Romans 8:19-22), then what we do now—justice, stewardship, love—has eternal significance.

**4. Embodied Ethics**

What we do with our bodies is not separate from "spiritual" life. Sexuality, food, work, rest—all are part of holistic discipleship.

**5. Incarnation Makes Sense**

If the body is just a shell, why did God take on flesh? The Incarnation affirms: bodies are good, matter matters, God redeems whole persons.

## The Tension Remains

**Greek categories offer clarity:**
- Soul and body are distinct
- Soul survives death
- Heaven is the intermediate state
- Resurrection reunites body and soul

**Hebrew framework offers biblical integrity:**
- Humans are unified embodied persons
- Death is real enemy (not liberation)
- Resurrection is essential (not optional)
- Hope is new creation (not escape from creation)

Perhaps the question isn't "Do I have a soul?" but "Am I a soul?" And perhaps the answer is: You are a whole person—dust and breath, body and life, made in God's [image](#man/image 'Hebrew'), destined for resurrection.
