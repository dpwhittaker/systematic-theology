"Let us make man in our image" (Genesis 1:26).

**Greek view:** Image = rational capacity, self-awareness, moral ability. Humans have something (reason, soul) that animals lack.

**Hebrew view:** Image = relational and vocational. Humans *represent* God to creation, *relate* to Him uniquely. Not a capacity we possess, but a calling we fulfill.

The difference: Essence we have vs. role we play.

# Created in God's Image

"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness'... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them" (Genesis 1:26-27).

What does it mean to be created in God's image? This question has divided Greek and Hebrew interpretations.

## Greek Interpretations: What We Have

Greek theology treats the image as a *capacity* or *quality* humans possess that distinguishes us from animals.

**1. Rationality**
We can think, reason, contemplate abstract ideas. Aristotle defined humans as "rational animals." Many church fathers (especially influenced by Greek philosophy) saw the image as our rational capacity.

*Implication:* Those with diminished rational capacity (severe disabilities, dementia) seem less fully image-bearers.

**2. Morality**
We have conscience, can discern right from wrong, make moral choices.

*Implication:* Morality distinguishes humans. But animals show proto-moral behavior (empathy, fairness).

**3. Immortal Soul**
We have an immaterial soul that survives death. Animals are purely material.

*Implication:* The image is the soul, not the body. But Genesis doesn't say God's image is our soul—it says *we* (whole persons) are made in His image.

**4. Self-Awareness**
We're conscious of ourselves as individuals, can reflect on our existence.

*Implication:* But many animals show self-awareness (mirror tests with primates, dolphins).

**5. Creativity**
We create art, culture, technology. We're sub-creators, reflecting God the Creator.

*Implication:* This is stronger, but still treats the image as a capacity.

### The Problem with Capacity-Based Views

**1. They're never stated in Scripture.**
Genesis doesn't say "the image of God is rationality" or "the image is the soul." We're reading these Greek categories into the text.

**2. They create a hierarchy.**
If the image is a capacity (reason, morality), then those with more capacity are "more image" than others. This has been used to justify slavery, oppression of the disabled, etc.

**3. They focus on what we have, not who we are.**
The image becomes a possession, not an identity.

## Hebrew Interpretation: What We Do

Hebrew thought focuses on *function* and *relationship*, not essence and capacity.

### Image as Royal Representation

In the ancient Near East, kings set up images (statues) of themselves in territories they ruled. The image *represented* the king's authority.

**Genesis 1:26-28 pattern:**
1. God makes humans in His image
2. Humans are given dominion over creation

**The connection:** To be God's image is to *represent* God's rule over creation. We're God's statues—living representatives of His authority and care.

**This is vocational:** The image isn't something we possess; it's a role we fulfill. We *image* God by exercising stewardship over creation on His behalf.

### Image as Relational

Only humans are addressed directly by God in Genesis 1. God speaks *to* us: "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28).

**The image includes:**
- Unique relationship with God (God speaks to us, not to animals)
- Relationship with each other ("male and female"—the image is corporate, not just individual)
- Relationship with creation (stewardship, not exploitation)

**This is relational:** The image is about being in covenant relationship with God, not about possessing a quality.

### Image as Whole Person

Genesis 2:7: "The LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."

Hebrew: *nephesh chayyah* (נפש חיה) - [living being/soul](#man/body-soul#genesis-2-7 'Hebrew').

**Key:** God doesn't create a body and add a soul. The whole person—dust + breath—*is* the living soul. Not a part we have, but what we are.

**The image is bodily:**
Genesis 1:27—"in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."

Maleness and femaleness are bodily. If the image were only the soul, why mention male and female in this verse?

The image includes our embodied, gendered, physical existence—not just an immaterial soul.

### Adam from Adamah

**Adam** (אדם) - human, man
**Adamah** (אדמה) - ground, earth

Wordplay: Humans are *earth-creatures*. We're from the dirt. Dust.

**Genesis 2:7:** "The LORD God formed the man (*adam*) of dust from the ground (*adamah*)."

**Genesis 3:19:** "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground (*adamah*), for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."

**We are earth.** Not elevated souls temporarily trapped in bodies, but earth-creatures given God's breath.

This is deeply *material*. We're not souls with bodies; we're embodied souls, ensouled bodies—living dust.

### Image as Commission

**Genesis 1:26:** "Let them have dominion..."

The image is tied to task. We're to steward creation, care for it, rule it rightly as God's representatives.

**Psalm 8:5-6:** "You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands."

The image is a royal commission—God's vice-regents, caring for His world.

**This is active:** The image isn't static (a capacity we passively possess). It's dynamic (a calling we actively fulfill).

## The Fall and the Image

**Question:** If the image is relational and vocational, did we lose it at the Fall?

**Genesis 9:6:** "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image."

*After* the Fall, humans are still said to be in God's image.

**Interpretation:**
- If the image is a capacity (reason), the Fall didn't erase it—we're still rational
- If the image is relational, the Fall damaged it—our relationship with God, each other, and creation is broken
- But we're still image-bearers, called to relationship and stewardship

**The Fall didn't erase the image, but it distorted our fulfillment of it:**
- We exploit creation instead of stewarding it
- We dominate each other instead of relating in love
- We hide from God instead of walking with Him

Redemption restores the image—not by giving us a new capacity, but by restoring relationship and renewing our vocation.

## Christ: The True Image

**Colossians 1:15:** "He is the image of the invisible God."
**2 Corinthians 4:4:** "Christ, who is the image of God."
**Hebrews 1:3:** "He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature."

Jesus is the true image—the perfect representation of God, the one who perfectly images God's character and will.

**We're being conformed to His image:**
**Romans 8:29:** "Predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."
**2 Corinthians 3:18:** "We all... are being transformed into the same image."

**Christian interpretation:** Adam was created in God's image, but Christ is the image. We're being restored to the image by being conformed to Christ.

**This is transformation, not possession:** We don't "get" the image back as a capacity. We're being transformed into Christlikeness—learning to image God rightly.

## Implications

If the image is relational and vocational (Hebrew view), not a capacity (Greek view):

**1. Every human is equally image-bearer**
Not more or less based on intelligence, ability, age, health. From conception to death, severely disabled or brilliant—all image-bearers.

**2. The image is corporate**
"Male and female"—we image God in relationship, not just as isolated individuals.

**3. The image is embodied**
Our bodies matter. Physical care, justice, feeding the hungry—all relate to honoring the image.

**4. The image is a calling**
We're to represent God rightly—stewarding creation, loving each other, reflecting His character.

**5. Redemption restores the image**
Salvation isn't escaping the body; it's being renewed as whole persons to fulfill our vocation.

Perhaps we are not souls trapped in bodies, but earth-creatures given divine breath, called to represent the Creator, loved and redeemed as whole persons—body and soul, dust and glory.
