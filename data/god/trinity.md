One God, three persons. How?

**Biblical data:** "The Lord is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4), yet Father, Son, and Spirit are each called God.
**Philosophical problem:** If God is one [essence](#god/essence 'Greek'), how can three persons exist without making three gods?

**Classical solution:** One *ousia* (essence), three *hypostases* (persons). Each person is fully God, distinguished by relations.

**The tension:** Does Greek "person" (hypostasis) match the biblical portrayal? If the essence is unchanging but the Son dies, have we split God to protect philosophy?

# One Essence, Three Persons

The doctrine of the Trinity is Christianity's most distinctive—and puzzling—claim about God. It's an attempt to reconcile biblical monotheism ("The Lord is one") with biblical revelation of Father, Son, and Spirit.

## The Biblical Data

Scripture presents both unity and plurality:

**Unity:**
- "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4)
- "I am the first and I am the last; besides Me there is no god" (Isaiah 44:6)
- Monotheism is foundational to Jewish and Christian faith

**Plurality:**
- The Father sends the Son (John 3:16, Galatians 4:4)
- The Son prays to the Father (John 17)
- The Spirit proceeds from the Father (John 15:26)
- "Baptize in the name [singular] of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19)
- Each is called God: Father (1 Peter 1:2), Son (John 1:1, 20:28), Spirit (Acts 5:3-4)

The church didn't invent this tension—it inherited it from Scripture. The question is: How do we make sense of it?

## The Philosophical Problem

Greek philosophy demands clarity: Is God one or three?

If one, then Father, Son, and Spirit are just masks—modes God wears at different times (modalism, condemned as heresy). But Scripture shows them *relating*: the Son prays to the Father, the Father sends the Spirit. These aren't the same person.

If three, then we have tritheism—three gods. But Scripture insists God is one.

Can both be true simultaneously?

## The Classical Formulation

The early church (especially the Cappadocian Fathers and Augustine) developed Trinitarian doctrine using Greek philosophical categories:

**One Essence (*ousia*)**:
- God's being, nature, substance
- What makes God God
- Shared equally by Father, Son, Spirit
- Indivisible, simple, one

**Three Persons (*hypostases*)**:
- Who exists in the divine essence
- Distinguished by their eternal relations:
  - The Father begets the Son (eternally, not in time)
  - The Son is begotten of the Father
  - The Spirit proceeds from the Father (and the Son, in Western theology)
- Not three parts of God, but three who *are* God

**Key Affirmations:**
- Each person is *fully* God, not one-third
- The persons are co-equal, co-eternal
- The essence is one; the persons are three
- The distinctions are real (not just appearances) but relational (not essential)

## Creeds and Councils

The church hammered out precise language to guard orthodoxy:

**Nicene Creed (325 AD, revised 381 AD):**
- The Son is "begotten, not made, of one substance (*homoousios*) with the Father"
- Rejects Arianism (the Son is a created being, not fully God)

**Chalcedonian Definition (451 AD):**
- Christ is one person with two natures (divine and human)
- Protects the Incarnation within Trinitarian framework

**Athanasian Creed (5th-6th century):**
- "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity"
- "Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance"

These formulations use Greek philosophical precision to state what Scripture reveals: God is one and three without contradiction.

## The Strength: Guarding Orthodoxy

The Trinity protects essential truths:

**Monotheism:**
- One God, not three
- Christianity remains biblically monotheistic

**Full Deity of Christ:**
- Jesus is not a demigod, angel, or exalted human
- "The Word was God" (John 1:1)
- Our salvation depends on this—only God can save

**Full Deity of the Spirit:**
- The Spirit is not an impersonal force
- He is God dwelling in believers

**Relational God:**
- God is eternally relational (Father-Son-Spirit) before creation
- Love is not something God started doing when He created—it's intrinsic to His being

**Defense Against Heresy:**
- Modalism: denied (the persons are distinct)
- Arianism: denied (the Son is fully God)
- Tritheism: denied (one essence)

## The Tension: Greek Categories and Hebrew Revelation

But does the formulation *capture* what Scripture reveals, or does it *translate* it into foreign categories?

### Person (Hypostasis) vs. Biblical Portrayal

In Greek philosophy, *hypostasis* means "subsistence" or "individual instance." It's a technical term, abstract.

But in Scripture:
- The Father is addressed as "Abba" (Daddy)—intimate, personal
- The Son weeps, prays, suffers
- The Spirit groans with us in prayer (Romans 8:26)

Are these "three modes of subsistence in the divine essence"—or are they three who *know*, *love*, *relate* to one another in ways that exceed philosophical abstraction?

### Essence vs. Action

The classical formulation says:
- The *essence* is one and unchanging
- The *persons* are distinguished by relations

But what happens when the Son becomes incarnate? If God's essence is immutable (unchanging), and the Son takes on human nature, suffers, and dies—have we split the Son from the essence?

Chalcedon says: The divine *nature* doesn't change; the human nature experiences suffering. But Scripture doesn't say "the human nature of Christ died." It says "*Christ* died" (Romans 5:8). The *person* died—God the Son.

Does the Greek category of "nature" protect philosophical assumptions (immutability, impassibility) at the expense of the biblical claim that God genuinely entered history, suffered, and died?

### Economic vs. Immanent Trinity

Theologians distinguish:

**Economic Trinity**: How God relates to creation (Father sends Son, Spirit applies redemption)
**Immanent Trinity**: Who God is in Himself, eternally (Father begets Son, Spirit proceeds)

The assumption: The economic reveals the immanent. How God *acts* toward us reflects who He *is* eternally.

But does Greek philosophy's demand for static, unchanging essence allow the economic Trinity to fully reveal the immanent? If God's essence doesn't change, can His actions in history truly reveal His nature—or are they accommodations, illustrations, "less than" His true being?

### Paradox or Mystery?

The Trinity is often called a "mystery"—truth beyond full comprehension. But is it mystery (truth we can't fully grasp) or paradox (apparent contradiction)?

Greek logic says: A cannot be both B and not-B simultaneously. God cannot be both one and three in the same sense.

The classical solution: God is one in *essence*, three in *persons*. Different senses, so no contradiction.

But does this resolve the mystery—or tame it? Does it make the Trinity logically coherent by fitting it into Greek categories—or does it preserve Hebrew revelation's resistance to systematization?

## The Hebrew Alternative?

Judaism never developed a doctrine of the Trinity. It preserves strict monotheism, resisting any hint of plurality in God.

But it also preserved paradoxes:
- God is utterly transcendent, yet dwells with the humble (Isaiah 57:15)
- God is one, yet His *Shekinah* (presence) and His *Memra* (Word) are spoken of as distinct

The Talmud doesn't resolve these tensions. It lets them stand, trusting that God exceeds human categories.

Perhaps the Trinity is best understood not as a philosophical puzzle solved, but as a revealed reality confessed. We don't understand *how* God is one and three—we trust that He is, because Scripture shows Him to be.

## Worship, Not Just Definition

The Trinity is doxology before it's theology. The church baptizes "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." The church prays to the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit.

This is lived experience before it's philosophical proposition. We *encounter* the Triune God in worship, prayer, sacrament.

Perhaps Greek precision helps us think clearly. But perhaps Hebrew wonder keeps us worshiping rightly—aware that the God we confess exceeds the categories we use to confess Him.

One God, three persons. Not explanation, but adoration.
