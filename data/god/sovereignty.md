God's absolute control versus human freedom. Can both be true?

**Biblical data:** "The Lord rules over all" (Psalm 103:19) and "Choose this day whom you will serve" (Joshua 24:15).
**Philosophical problem:** If God ordains all things, are humans free? If humans are free, is God truly sovereign?

**Attempted solutions:**
- *Calvinism*: God's will always accomplished; humans choose according to divinely-determined desires.
- *Arminianism*: God limits His sovereignty to preserve genuine freedom; humans can resist grace.
- *Molinism*: God's "middle knowledge" harmonizes sovereignty with free choice.

**The tension:** Scripture tells stories (Pharaoh, Joseph) rather than offering systematic theories. Perhaps the paradox *is* the revelation.

# Divine Control and Human Freedom

One of theology's oldest debates: If God is sovereign—ruling over all, ordaining all events—can humans be truly free? And if humans have genuine freedom to choose, is God's sovereignty limited?

Greek philosophy demands logical coherence. Scripture presents both truths side by side, seemingly unconcerned with reconciling them systematically.

## The Biblical Data

Scripture affirms both divine sovereignty and human responsibility:

**Sovereignty:**
- "The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all" (Psalm 103:19)
- "In Him we were chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will" (Ephesians 1:11)
- "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He will" (Proverbs 21:1)
- God ordains Christ's crucifixion: "This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge" (Acts 2:23)

**Human Responsibility:**
- "Choose this day whom you will serve" (Joshua 24:15)
- "Whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16)
- "Why do you not believe Me?" (John 8:46)—Jesus holds people accountable for unbelief
- Those who crucified Christ are guilty: "You, with the help of wicked men, put Him to death" (Acts 2:23—same verse that affirms God's plan!)

The same events are attributed to both God's decree and human choice. How?

## The Philosophical Problem

Greek logic says: Either God determines all things (determinism), or humans have free will (libertarian freedom). Both cannot be fully true.

**If God determines all:**
- Human choices are not free in the ultimate sense
- Humans choose what God ordained they would choose
- Responsibility seems undermined—how can we be blamed for doing what God decreed?

**If humans have free will:**
- God's sovereignty is limited—He doesn't control all outcomes
- His plans can be thwarted by human rebellion
- Foreknowledge is possible, but foreordination is not

Christianity has wrestled with this for centuries, producing three major positions.

## Calvinism: Sovereignty Emphasized

Named after John Calvin (though he built on Augustine), this view emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty:

**Key Tenets:**
- **Total Depravity**: Humans are so corrupted by sin that they cannot choose God without His intervention
- **Unconditional Election**: God chooses who will be saved, not based on foreseen faith but on His sovereign will
- **Limited Atonement**: Christ died specifically for the elect
- **Irresistible Grace**: When God calls the elect, they will respond—grace cannot ultimately be resisted
- **Perseverance of the Saints**: Those truly saved cannot lose their salvation

**On Freedom:**
Humans are free in a *compatibilist* sense:
- We choose according to our desires
- Our desires are shaped by our nature (sinful or regenerate)
- God ordains our nature, thus ordains our choices
- We are responsible because we choose what we want—even though what we want is determined

**Strengths:**
- God's sovereignty is protected—His plans are never thwarted
- Salvation is entirely of grace—no human contribution
- Emphasizes Scripture's strong sovereignty passages
- Provides assurance—if God chose you, you're secure

**Tensions:**
- If God ordains all things, including sin, is He the author of evil?
- If grace is irresistible, how do we make sense of passages urging us to "choose" or warning against resisting the Spirit?
- Does it make genuine human agency an illusion?

## Arminianism: Freedom Emphasized

Named after Jacobus Arminius, this view emphasizes human freedom:

**Key Tenets:**
- **Conditional Election**: God chooses those whom He foresees will believe
- **Universal Atonement**: Christ died for all people; the atonement is effective for those who believe
- **Resistible Grace**: God's grace enables us to choose, but we can refuse it
- **Potential for Apostasy**: Believers can fall away and lose salvation (though views vary)

**On Freedom:**
Humans have *libertarian* free will:
- We can choose otherwise than we actually choose
- God's sovereignty is self-limited to allow genuine human freedom
- God foreknows what we will choose (He sees all of time), but He doesn't determine it
- Predestination is corporate (God predestines the church) or based on foreseen faith

**Strengths:**
- Human responsibility is clear—we genuinely choose
- God is not the author of evil—humans freely sin
- Evangelism and exhortation make sense—people can respond or refuse
- Appeals to our intuitive sense of freedom

**Tensions:**
- Does foreseen faith mean we contribute to our salvation (contrary to grace alone)?
- If God's plans depend on human choices, can He guarantee outcomes (like Christ's return, final victory)?
- Does it limit God's sovereignty in ways Scripture doesn't?

## Molinism: Middle Ground

Named after Luis de Molina, this view attempts to preserve both sovereignty and freedom through "middle knowledge":

**Key Tenets:**
- God has three types of knowledge:
  - **Natural knowledge**: What is necessarily true (logic, mathematics)
  - **Middle knowledge**: What every possible free creature *would* freely choose in every possible circumstance
  - **Free knowledge**: What will actually happen, given God's creative decree

**How It Works:**
- God knows (via middle knowledge) what every person would freely do in every possible scenario
- God then creates the world where His purposes are achieved through genuinely free human choices
- God doesn't force choices, but He sovereignly arranges circumstances so that free choices accomplish His will

**Strengths:**
- Preserves both divine sovereignty and human freedom
- God guarantees outcomes without coercing choices
- Explains how God can ordain the crucifixion while humans freely (and guiltily) carry it out

**Tensions:**
- Is "middle knowledge" philosophically coherent? How can God know what free creatures *would* do before He decides to create them?
- Does it collapse into Calvinism (if God chose this world knowing what we'd choose, didn't He determine our choices?)
- Is it biblical, or an overly philosophical attempt to solve a mystery Scripture leaves unresolved?

## The Biblical Narrative Approach

All three views assume we must *systematize* the relationship between sovereignty and freedom. But Scripture doesn't give us a theological treatise—it tells *stories*.

**Pharaoh's Heart:**
God hardens Pharaoh's heart (Exodus 9:12), yet Pharaoh hardens his own heart (Exodus 8:15). God judges Pharaoh for his hardness. Both divine action and human responsibility are affirmed without explanation.

**Joseph's Brothers:**
"You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good" (Genesis 50:20). The brothers' choices were morally evil (they're guilty), yet God ordained those very events for His purposes. Two agents, one event.

**The Crucifixion:**
"This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put Him to death" (Acts 2:23). God's plan and human guilt coexist.

**Paul's Paradox:**
"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill His good purpose" (Philippians 2:12-13). Human effort and divine enablement—both/and.

## The Hebrew Tension

Hebrew thought is comfortable with paradox. The Talmud preserves contradictory rabbinic opinions: *eilu v'eilu*—"these and these are both the words of the living God."

Perhaps the sovereignty-freedom tension is like this. Scripture doesn't resolve it because the resolution is less important than living faithfully within the tension:
- Pray as if everything depends on God (because it does)
- Act as if everything depends on you (because you're responsible)
- Trust God's sovereignty when events are beyond your control
- Exercise your agency when choices are before you

Greek philosophy wants a system. Hebrew faith wants obedience.

## What's at Stake?

**If we collapse into pure sovereignty (determinism):**
- Moral responsibility becomes unclear
- Sin seems inevitable, not culpable
- God appears to be the author of evil

**If we collapse into pure freedom (libertarianism):**
- God's sovereignty is compromised
- His promises may not be certain
- Salvation depends partly on us

**If we hold both:**
- We live in mystery
- We worship a God bigger than our logic
- We trust what we cannot fully comprehend

Perhaps that's the point. The Living God is not bound by the law of non-contradiction as we understand it. He is sovereign over all, yet holds us genuinely accountable. Both are true—even if we can't explain how.

The mystery is not a problem to solve but a reality to embrace.
