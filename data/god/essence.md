Greek philosophy asks: What *is* God's fundamental nature?

The quest for essence—the unchanging reality that makes God God.
Classical theism: God is *simple* (no parts), *eternal* (outside time), *immutable* (unchanging), *impassible* (unaffected by creation), *necessary* (cannot not-exist).

This is the God of the philosophers: unmoved mover, first cause, pure being.

The risk: Does defining God's essence make Him an object of study rather than a Subject to be encountered?
Hebrew thought responds: God is not *what* but *Who*—known through [relationship](#god/covenants 'Hebrew'), not definition.

# The Quest for Essence

Greek philosophy, particularly from Plato and Aristotle, introduced a way of thinking fundamentally different from the Hebrew mind. Where Hebrew thought moved through *story*, Greek thought moved through *definition*. Where Hebrew revelation came through God's *actions* in history, Greek wisdom came through contemplation of eternal *being*.

The central question: *What IS a thing?* Not what does it do, not how does it relate, but what is its fundamental nature—its *essence*—that makes it what it is and not something else?

## Plato's Forms

For Plato, the physical world is a shadow. True reality exists in the realm of *Forms*—perfect, eternal, unchanging templates. This is *abstraction*: stripping away the particular to reach the universal.

This method yields knowledge that is:
- **Universal**: True for all instances, everywhere, always
- **Eternal**: Unchanging across time
- **Necessary**: Cannot be otherwise
- **Contextless**: Independent of circumstance, history, relationship

## Aristotle's Essence

Aristotle modified Plato but kept the core move. He rejected separate Forms but retained *essence* as the defining characteristic. A thing's essence is what it *must* have to be that kind of thing.

This leads to *definition*: capturing essence in precise language. A good definition states necessary and sufficient conditions.

## Applied to God: Classical Theism

When early Christian theologians—trained in Greek philosophy—turned to describe God, they brought these tools. What IS God's *essence*?

**God's Essential Nature:**

**Simple**: Has no parts, is not composite
- Not made of matter and form, body and soul, essence and existence
- What God is and that God is are identical
- All of God's attributes are identical with His essence

**Eternal**: Outside time, unchanging
- No past or future, only eternal present
- Does not experience succession of moments
- All of God's knowledge and will are eternally actual

**Immutable**: Does not change in essence or will
- His character is perfectly stable
- His promises are reliable
- His plans do not shift

**Impassible**: Not affected by creation, does not suffer
- Not moved by external forces
- Emotions (if any) do not arise from creatures
- Maintains perfect freedom and sovereignty

**Necessary**: Cannot not-exist; all else is contingent
- Existence belongs to His nature (unlike creatures who receive existence)
- All other beings depend on Him; He depends on nothing
- He is the ultimate explanation for why anything exists

## The Strength: Clarity and Defense

This approach provides:
- **Precision**: We can state clearly what orthodoxy believes
- **Consistency**: Logical coherence in theological claims
- **Defense against heresy**: Clear boundaries for acceptable doctrine
- **Universality**: Truths about God that transcend culture and history

## The Hebrew Critique

But here the tension emerges: **What is lost when we reduce God to His essential characteristics?**

### The Personal Becomes Impersonal

Essence is a category for *things*, not *persons*. You can define a triangle's essence, but can you define your mother's? When you abstract away her particular acts, her specific words to *you*, her unique presence in *your* history—what remains?

A list of attributes? But these are categories, not *her*. The essence of personhood resists abstraction. Persons are known through *encounter*, not definition.

Scripture reveals God as supremely personal: "I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3:14). Not "I am the unmoved mover" or "I am pure actuality." When Moses asks *who* God is, God responds with a name tied to presence and action: "I will be with you."

### The Historical Becomes Timeless

Greek thought values the eternal over the temporal. Truth must be unchanging, always valid. But the God of Scripture acts *in history*:
- He calls Abraham at a specific time
- He delivers Israel from Egypt in a specific event
- He becomes incarnate in Jesus at a specific moment

These are not illustrations of timeless truths—they ARE the revelation. God's character is disclosed *through* these acts, not apart from them.

### The Relational Becomes Categorical

Essence thinking prioritizes *what* over *who*. It asks: What kind of being is God? What category does He fit? What are His properties?

But Hebrew revelation is relational:
- "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (not "the God of philosophers")
- "I am your God; you are my people" (covenant language, not categorical)
- "As a father has compassion on his children..." (relational metaphor, not attribute list)

Relationship cannot be captured by definition. A father is not just "one who exhibits paternal attributes." He is *your* father—particular, irreducible, known through shared history.

### The Dynamic Becomes Static

Greek essence is *static*—it doesn't change, develop, or respond. But God in Scripture:
- *Grieves* at human wickedness (Genesis 6:6)
- *Relents* from planned judgment (Exodus 32:14)
- *Rejoices* over His people (Zephaniah 3:17)
- *Wrestles* with Jacob (Genesis 32)

Are these just anthropomorphisms—human projections onto an unchanging essence? Or do they reveal a God who genuinely *engages*, who enters into dynamic relationship, whose actions are real responses, not pre-programmed outputs?

The doctrine of divine immutability protects important truths: God is not fickle, His character is reliable, His promises stand. But if pressed too far—if God's essence is utterly static—can He truly love? Love requires response, vulnerability, the freedom to be affected by the beloved.

## The Living God

Ultimately, the question is: **Can a living God fit into the categories of Greek philosophy without ceasing to be the God who acts, speaks, covenants, suffers, and saves?**

The Hebrew model: God is known through *story*. Through His dealings with Israel. Through the Incarnation—where the eternal Word becomes flesh, enters history, suffers and dies.

The Greek model: God is known through *contemplation* of His essence. His acts illustrate His nature, but the nature itself is grasped through philosophical reasoning about necessity, causation, perfection.

Can both be true? Can the God who IS (essence) also be the God who ACTS (event)? Can systematic theology honor both the eternal and the historical, the categorical and the personal, the defined and the encountered?

Or must we choose: Will we know God as *what* or as *Who*?
