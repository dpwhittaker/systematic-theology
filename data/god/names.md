[God](#god/god 'Parent')

In Hebrew culture, names reveal identity and character.

God's names are not labels but *self-disclosures*—who He reveals Himself to be in specific encounters:

*YHWH* (יהוה): "I AM WHO I AM"—presence, not definition.
*Elohim* (אלהים): Creator, Mighty One.
*Adonai* (אדני): Lord, covenant head.
*El Shaddai* (אל שדי): God Almighty.

Each name arises from a moment in history where God [acted](#god/acts 'Hebrew') and revealed Himself.
Naming is not taxonomy—it's testimony. "This is who He showed Himself to be *to me*, *in this moment*."

# Identity Through Self-Disclosure

In the ancient world, names carried weight. To know someone's name was to know their character, their essence, their role. Naming was an act of authority (Adam names the animals) or revelation (God names Abram → Abraham).

God reveals Himself through *names*—not labels we assign, but identities He discloses. Each name emerges from encounter, from story, from God's self-revelation in history.

## YHWH: The Sacred Name

**"God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM'"** (Exodus 3:14)

Hebrew: אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה (*Ehyeh asher ehyeh*)

The context: Moses asks God's name at the burning bush. Who should he say sent him? God responds with a name that is both revelation and mystery.

**The Name:**
YHWH (יהוה) is the personal name of God, rendered "LORD" (small caps) in most English Bibles. It derives from the verb *hayah* (to be), suggesting:
- **Existence**: I AM—self-existent, eternal being
- **Presence**: I AM (here, with you)—not abstract but engaged
- **Becoming**: I WILL BE—dynamic, active in history

Not a definition ("God is Being Itself") but a promise: "I will be who I will be" or "I will be there as who I am there." God's identity is tied to His presence and action, not to a static philosophical category.

**Holiness:**
The name was so sacred that Jews would not pronounce it aloud. In reading Scripture, they substituted *Adonai* (Lord). To this day, observant Jews write "G-d" or refer to *HaShem* (The Name).

Why? Because the name is not merely a word—it is God's self-disclosure, His very presence made audible. To speak it lightly is to treat God's presence lightly.

**Usage:**
YHWH appears over 6,800 times in the Hebrew Bible. It is *the* personal name, the covenant name, the name associated with God's saving acts:
- "YHWH brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2)
- "YHWH, YHWH, a God merciful and gracious..." (Exodus 34:6)

This is the name tied to relationship, to Israel's particular history with their God.

## Elohim: Creator and Judge

**"In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth"** (Genesis 1:1)

Hebrew: אֱלֹהִים (*Elohim*)

A plural form (ending in -im), yet used with singular verbs. This has led to various interpretations:
- **Plural of majesty**: Emphasizes God's greatness
- **Plural of fullness**: Hints at the complexity of God's being (later Christian interpreters saw hints of Father, Son, Spirit)
- **Generic term**: Related to *El* (god, mighty one), made plural to indicate supreme deity

**Usage:**
- **Creation**: Elohim is the name used in Genesis 1 for the Creator
- **Judgment**: Elohim is the God of justice, the judge of all the earth
- **Power**: Emphasizes transcendence, might, sovereignty

Elohim is the universal name—the God over all creation, all nations. YHWH is the particular name—the God in covenant with Israel.

Genesis uses both strategically: Elohim creates (Genesis 1). YHWH Elohim forms the man and walks in the garden (Genesis 2-3)—combining transcendent Creator with personal presence.

## Adonai: Lord and Master

Hebrew: אֲדֹנָי (*Adonai*)

**Meaning:**
"My Lord" or "Master"—a term of authority and submission. It indicates:
- **Relationship**: He is *my* Lord (possessive, personal)
- **Authority**: He is Master; I am servant
- **Covenant**: He has rights over me; I owe Him allegiance

**Usage:**
Often paired with YHWH: "Adonai YHWH" (Lord GOD). When Jews avoid speaking YHWH, they substitute Adonai—so "YHWH" is read aloud as "Adonai."

This is covenant language. God is not a distant philosophical principle. He is Lord—our covenant head, to whom we owe obedience, worship, love.

## El Shaddai: God Almighty

**"I am El Shaddai"** (Genesis 17:1)

Hebrew: אֵל שַׁדַּי (*El Shaddai*)

**Meaning:**
- *El*: God, mighty one
- *Shaddai*: Uncertain etymology. Possibly "mountain" (God of the mountain), "destroyer" (Almighty), or related to a root meaning "breast" (nurturing sustainer)

**Usage:**
God reveals Himself as El Shaddai to Abraham (Genesis 17:1), Isaac (Genesis 28:3), and Jacob (Genesis 35:11). It emphasizes power, sufficiency, provision.

Later, Job uses "Shaddai" frequently (31 times)—the Almighty who does as He pleases, whose ways are beyond human understanding.

## Compound Names: God's Acts Become His Names

Hebrew thought creates compound names by attaching YHWH to a description of His action. Each arises from a specific event:

**YHWH Jireh** (יהוה יִרְאֶה): "The Lord Will Provide"
- Genesis 22:14, after God provides a ram instead of Isaac
- Naming captures the moment: God provided when Abraham trusted

**YHWH Nissi** (יהוה נִסִּי): "The Lord Is My Banner"
- Exodus 17:15, after victory over Amalek
- God's presence was the rallying point, the banner under which they fought

**YHWH Shalom** (יהוה שָׁלוֹם): "The Lord Is Peace"
- Judges 6:24, after God assures Gideon he will not die
- Naming the altar commemorates the encounter

**YHWH Rapha** (יהוה רָפָא): "The Lord Who Heals"
- Exodus 15:26, after God makes bitter water sweet
- He reveals Himself as healer through the act of healing

**YHWH Rohi** (יהוה רֹעִי): "The Lord Is My Shepherd"
- Psalm 23:1, David's testimony of God's guidance
- Shepherding is not just an attribute—it's identity

These names don't categorize God. They *testify* to who He showed Himself to be in a particular moment. The name preserves the memory, keeps the encounter alive.

## Naming vs. Defining

Greek philosophy seeks to *define* God—to state His essence in precise, universal terms. "God is X" where X is unchanging, eternal, applicable everywhere.

Hebrew thought *names* God—to testify to who He revealed Himself to be in specific encounters. "YHWH did this" or "El Shaddai showed Himself as that."

The difference:
- **Definition** is timeless; **naming** is historical
- **Definition** is categorical; **naming** is relational
- **Definition** is third-person (about God); **naming** is second-person (to God) or first-person (God's self-disclosure)

When God says "I AM," He's not offering a philosophical definition of divine essence. He's giving Moses (and us) a name by which to call Him, to invoke His presence, to remember His covenant.

## The Power of the Name

In Hebrew thought, to know God's name is to know God. Not comprehensively—God remains mystery. But truly—He has made Himself known.

To call on the name of YHWH is to call on YHWH Himself. The name is not separate from the person. This is why:
- The name is holy (Exodus 20:7—do not take it in vain)
- The name is powerful (Joel 2:32—whoever calls on the name of YHWH will be saved)
- The name is presence (Deuteronomy 12:5—the place where YHWH causes His name to dwell)

Jesus taught His disciples to pray "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name" (Matthew 6:9). The name is still central, still holy, still the means by which we address and encounter God.

And ultimately, the Name becomes flesh: "She will bear a son, and you shall call His name *Jesus* [YHWH saves], for He will save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).

The God who reveals Himself through names gives His final name in a person—Immanuel, "God with us" (Matthew 1:23). The ultimate self-disclosure: not a word but the Word made flesh.
