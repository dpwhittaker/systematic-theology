If God has an [essence](#god/essence 'Greek'), what qualities flow from it?

Classical theology lists God's *attributes*—the characteristics that define His nature:
*Omnipotent* (all-powerful), *omniscient* (all-knowing), *omnipresent* (everywhere), *holy* (set apart), *just* (upholds righteousness), *loving* (wills the good).

These are *universal truths*—statements about God that are always true, everywhere, for everyone.
"God is love" becomes a timeless proposition about divine essence.

But Hebrew thought asks: Is "God is love" the same truth as "God loved Jacob"?
One is eternal; the other is particular. One is categorical; the other is relational.

# Attributes: Defining the Divine

If Greek philosophy seeks God's essence, it also seeks to catalog His *attributes*—the qualities that flow from that essence. An attribute is a characteristic that belongs to God's nature, that helps us understand what He is like.

Classical systematic theology organizes these into categories:

## Incommunicable Attributes

These belong to God alone, cannot be shared with creatures:

**Aseity** (self-existence):
- God depends on nothing outside Himself
- He has life in Himself (John 5:26)
- All creatures derive existence from Him; He derives from no one

**Infinity**:
- Not limited by space, time, or any created thing
- Unlimited in power, knowledge, presence
- Transcends all categories we use for created beings

**Immutability**:
- Does not change in essence, character, or purpose
- "I the Lord do not change" (Malachi 3:6)
- His promises are utterly reliable

**Simplicity**:
- Has no parts; is not composed of anything
- His attributes are not separate pieces but identical with His essence
- What He *is* and *that* He is are the same

## Communicable Attributes

These can be reflected (imperfectly) in creatures:

**Omnipotence** (all-powerful):
- Can do all things consistent with His nature
- Not limited by created forces
- "Nothing is impossible with God" (Luke 1:37)

**Omniscience** (all-knowing):
- Knows all things actual and possible
- Past, present, future are all present to His mind
- Knows every thought, intention, secret

**Omnipresence** (present everywhere):
- Fully present at every point in space
- "Where can I flee from Your presence?" (Psalm 139:7)
- Not that He is spread thin, but fully present everywhere

**Holiness**:
- Set apart, transcendent, utterly other
- Morally perfect, cannot sin or approve evil
- The seraphim cry "Holy, holy, holy" (Isaiah 6:3)

**Justice**:
- Upholds righteousness, judges evil
- Gives to each what is due
- Cannot ignore sin or leave it unpunished

**Love**:
- Wills the good of His creatures
- Sacrificial, seeking the beloved's welfare
- "God is love" (1 John 4:8)

**Mercy**:
- Withholds deserved punishment
- Compassionate toward the suffering
- "Slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love" (Psalm 103:8)

**Wisdom**:
- Perfect knowledge rightly applied
- Always chooses the best means to the best ends
- His ways are higher than ours (Isaiah 55:8-9)

## The Strength: Systematic Understanding

Cataloging attributes provides:
- **Clarity**: We know specifically what we mean by "God"
- **Balance**: We don't overemphasize one trait at the expense of others
- **Worship**: Each attribute gives reason for praise
- **Defense**: We can identify heresy (denying omnipotence, claiming God changes essence, etc.)

This is why creeds and confessions list God's attributes—to state clearly what the church believes and to guard against distortion.

## The Hebrew Tension

But the Hebrew mind resists this approach. Not because the attributes are *false*, but because the method may obscure something essential.

### Propositions vs. Narrative

Compare:
- **Greek**: "God is love" (timeless proposition about essence)
- **Hebrew**: "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son" (John 3:16—event in history)

The proposition is *universal*—always true, everywhere. The narrative is *particular*—happened once, in a specific time and place.

Systematic theology tends to extract propositions from narrative:
- Read: "God delivered Israel from Egypt"
- Extract: "God is a deliverer" (attribute)
- Categorize: Add to list of God's characteristics

But the Hebrew mind resists this move. The *story* is the truth. God didn't deliver Israel to *illustrate* that He's a deliverer. He delivered Israel because He loved them, called them, made promises to Abraham. The particular act reveals His character more fully than any abstract proposition could.

When we reduce "God loved Jacob" to "God is love," we gain universality but lose particularity. We can now apply "God is love" to all people, all times. But we've left behind the specific, scandalous, inexplicable reality: God chose Jacob over Esau. God loved *this* person in *this* way at *this* moment.

### Static Essence vs. Living Presence

Greek attributes describe what God *is*—His static nature. But Scripture also reveals what God *does*:
- He grieves at human sin (Genesis 6:6)
- He relents from planned judgment (Exodus 32:14)
- He rejoices over His people (Zephaniah 3:17)

Are these just figures of speech? Anthropomorphisms we must interpret away to reach the "real" God described by attributes like immutability and impassibility?

Or do they reveal a God who genuinely *engages*—whose actions are real responses, not illustrations of pre-existing essence?

### Catalog vs. Encounter

You can study God's attributes without *knowing* God. You can pass a theology exam, list every attribute correctly, define each with precision—and never cry out "My God!" in desperation or worship.

Attributes are third-person language: "God is X." The Bible more often uses second-person: "You are my God." Relationship language, not catalog language.

The Psalms don't say "God possesses the attribute of being a refuge." They say "*You* are my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble" (Psalm 46:1). Direct address. Personal encounter.

## Can Both Be True?

The church has always affirmed both:
- God IS love (essence, attribute, unchanging nature)
- God LOVES you (action, relationship, personal address)

But the question is whether Greek categorical thinking can fully honor the Hebrew relational knowing. Can we say "God is omnipotent" and "God wrestled with Jacob all night" (Genesis 32) without one canceling the other?

Perhaps the attributes are true but insufficient. Perhaps they describe God rightly but incompletely. Perhaps we need both the catalog and the encounter—the definition and the relationship.

Or perhaps we must hold them in tension, refusing to collapse either into the other, living with the mystery that the Eternal God enters time, the Unchanging One responds to prayer, the Impassible Lord weeps over Jerusalem.

The Living God transcends our categories—even the true ones.
