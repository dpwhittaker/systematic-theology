The *Eternal Creator*.

Key questions:
- *Trinity* - One God in three persons?
- *Attributes* - What is God like? (omnipotent, omniscient, holy, love)
- *Sovereignty* - How much control does God exercise?
- *Providence* - How does God interact with creation?
- *Impassibility* - Can God suffer or feel emotion?

The Hebrew approach: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious..."
The Greek approach: First cause, unmoved mover, pure being.
