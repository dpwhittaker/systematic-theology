The *Eternal Creator*. How do we know Him?

**Greek approach:** Define what God *is*.
- [Essence](#god/essence 'Greek'): Unchanging, eternal being—the philosophers' God.
- [Attributes](#god/attributes 'Greek'): Omnipotent, omniscient, holy, love.
- [Reconciliation](#god/reconciliation 'Greek'): [Trinity](#god/trinity 'Drill'), [Sovereignty](#god/sovereignty 'Drill'), [Providence](#god/providence 'Drill'), [Incarnation](#god/incarnation 'Drill'), [Impassibility](#god/impassibility 'Drill')—attempts to reconcile classical theism with biblical revelation.

**Hebrew approach:** Encounter who God is *to us*.
- [Images](#god/images 'Hebrew'): Shepherd, rock, fire, father—concrete metaphors that reveal character.
- [Names](#god/names 'Hebrew'): YHWH, Elohim, Adonai—self-disclosure through identity.
- [Covenants](#god/covenants 'Hebrew'): Abraham, Sinai, David—relationship sealed in blood.
- [Acts](#god/acts 'Hebrew'): Creation, Exodus, Incarnation—God known through deeds.

Can both be true? The God who *is* and the God who *acts*?
