The *Eternal Creator*.

How do we know God?

**Greek approach:** [Define](#intro/philosophy 'Greek') His essence and attributes.
What IS God? Omnipotent, omniscient, eternal, immutable, impassible.
First cause, unmoved mover, pure being.

**Hebrew approach:** Encounter Him through His [acts](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew'), [names](#intro/relation 'Hebrew'), [images](#intro/relation 'Hebrew'), and [covenants](#intro/relation 'Hebrew').
Who is God *to us*? The One who delivered us, the God of Abraham, our covenant partner.

The tension: Can essence-language capture the Living God?

# Two Ways of Knowing God

The Greeks asked: **What is God's nature?** They sought to define divine essence through philosophical reasoning—unmoved mover, necessary being, pure actuality. God's *attributes* flow from His essence: omnipotence, omniscience, immutability, simplicity.

This yields systematic questions:
- **Trinity**: One essence in three persons?
- **Attributes**: What qualities define God's nature? (holy, love, just, merciful)
- **Sovereignty**: How much control does He exercise over creation?
- **Providence**: How does He interact with the world?
- **Impassibility**: Can He suffer or feel emotion, or is He unchanging?

These are *categorical* questions—attempts to systematize God's being into logical propositions.

The Hebrews asked: **Who is God to us?** They encountered the Lord through history, covenant, and relationship. God reveals Himself not by defining His essence but by acting, naming Himself, showing His character through deeds.

This yields experiential knowledge:
- **Images**: Fire, rock, shepherd, father, warrior, husband
- **Names**: YHWH (I AM), Elohim (Creator), Adonai (Lord), El Shaddai (Almighty)
- **Acts**: Creation, Exodus, giving Torah, presence in the Tabernacle
- **Covenants**: Promises to Abraham, Sinai bond with Israel, David's throne

These are *relational* markers—ways of knowing God through encounter, not encyclopedia.

# The Greek Method: Essence and Attributes

Greek philosophy begins with *essence*—the fundamental nature that makes a thing what it is. Applied to God, this produces classical theism:

**God's Essence:**
- *Simple*: Has no parts, is not composite
- *Eternal*: Outside time, unchanging
- *Immutable*: Does not change in essence or will
- *Impassible*: Not affected by creation, does not suffer
- *Necessary*: Cannot not-exist; all else is contingent

**God's Attributes** (flowing from essence):
- *Omnipotent*: All-powerful
- *Omniscient*: All-knowing
- *Omnipresent*: Present everywhere
- *Holy*: Set apart, morally perfect
- *Just*: Upholds righteousness
- *Loving*: Wills the good of His creatures

This approach seeks *universal truths*—statements about God that are always true, everywhere, for everyone. "God is love" becomes a timeless proposition about divine essence, not just a description of God's historical dealings with Israel.

The strength: Clarity, consistency, defense against heresy. We can say with precision what orthodoxy believes and test new claims against it.

The risk: **Does defining God's essence make Him an object of study rather than a Subject to be encountered?**

# The Hebrew Method: Images, Names, Acts, Covenants

Hebrew Scripture reveals God differently—through vivid, concrete, relational language.

## Images: God in Metaphor

The Bible describes God with earthy, physical images:

- **Shepherd** (Psalm 23): He leads, provides, protects
- **Rock** (Deuteronomy 32:4): He is stable, refuge, foundation
- **Fire** (Exodus 3, 19): He is holy, dangerous, purifying
- **Father** (Hosea 11:1-4): He teaches, disciplines, loves tenderly
- **Warrior** (Exodus 15:3): He fights for His people
- **Mother bird** (Psalm 91:4): He shelters under His wings
- **Husband** (Hosea 2): He is faithful despite betrayal

These are not *illustrations* of abstract attributes—they are the way God chooses to reveal His character. He doesn't say "I possess the attribute of protective care." He says "As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you" (Isaiah 66:13).

Greek theology worries: Aren't these anthropomorphisms—human projections we must strip away to reach God's true, non-material essence? Hebrew thought responds: What if these images *are* the revelation? What if God cannot be known apart from metaphor, because He transcends literal description?

## Names: Identity Through Self-Disclosure

In Hebrew culture, names reveal character and relationship. God's names are not labels but self-disclosures:

**YHWH** (יהוה): "I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3:14)
- The sacred name, revealed to Moses at the burning bush
- Root: *hayah* (to be)—presence, existence, becoming
- Not a definition ("God is Being Itself") but a promise: "I will be with you"
- So holy it was not spoken aloud; Jews say *Adonai* (Lord) or *HaShem* (The Name)

**Elohim** (אלהים): Creator, Mighty One
- First name in Scripture (Genesis 1:1)
- Plural form (hints at majesty or, later, Trinity)
- Emphasizes power, transcendence

**Adonai** (אדני): Lord, Master
- Relational authority—He is *our* Lord
- Covenant headship

**El Shaddai** (אל שדי): God Almighty
- Revealed to Abraham (Genesis 17:1)
- Possibly "God of the Mountain" or "God of sustenance"

**YHWH Jireh**: The Lord Will Provide (Genesis 22:14)
**YHWH Shalom**: The Lord Is Peace (Judges 6:24)
**YHWH Rapha**: The Lord Who Heals (Exodus 15:26)

Each name arises from a specific encounter, a moment in history where God acted and revealed Himself. Naming is not taxonomy—it's testimony. "This is who He showed Himself to be *to me*, *in this moment*."

## Acts: God Known Through Deeds

Hebrew theology is inseparable from history. God reveals His character through what He *does*:

**Creation** (Genesis 1-2):
- He speaks the world into being
- He forms humanity in His image
- He rests on the seventh day (Sabbath)
- Reveals: Power, creativity, intentionality, desire for relationship

**Call of Abraham** (Genesis 12):
- God chooses one man, promises descendants, land, blessing to all nations
- Reveals: Initiative, grace (Abraham did nothing to earn this), faithfulness

**Exodus** (Exodus 1-15):
- God hears Israel's cry, delivers them from slavery, drowns Pharaoh's army
- The foundational event of Jewish identity
- Reveals: Compassion, justice, power over empires, loyalty to the oppressed

**Giving of Torah** (Exodus 19-20):
- God meets Israel at Sinai, speaks the Ten Commandments, establishes covenant
- Reveals: Holiness, desire for relationship, care for how His people live

**Presence in Tabernacle/Temple**:
- God dwells among His people in fire and cloud
- Reveals: Immanence (He is near), holiness (approach carefully), faithfulness (He doesn't abandon them)

**Judgment and Exile**:
- God sends prophets, warns of consequences, allows Babylon to conquer Judah
- Reveals: Justice, patience, grief over sin

**Incarnation** (Christian continuation):
- God becomes flesh in Jesus Christ
- The ultimate act: God enters creation, suffers, dies, rises
- Reveals: Love, humility, victory over death

In Hebrew thought, these acts are not *illustrations* of pre-existing attributes. They *are* the revelation. We don't say "God delivered Israel because He has the attribute of being a deliverer." We say "God IS a deliverer because He delivered Israel."

The difference is profound: Greek thought abstracts universal essence from particular acts. Hebrew thought insists the particular act *is* the truth.

## Covenants: Relationship Over Definition

God binds Himself to His people through *berith* (covenant)—not a contract, but a family bond sealed by oath and blood.

**Covenant with Abraham** (Genesis 12, 15, 17):
- Unconditional promise: descendants, land, blessing
- Sealed by God alone walking between cut animals (Genesis 15)
- God takes the curse upon Himself if He breaks faith
- Marked in Abraham's flesh: circumcision

**Covenant at Sinai** (Exodus 19-24):
- "I will be your God, you will be My people"
- Not employment terms but family identity
- Law (Torah) is instruction for covenant life, not legal contract
- Sealed in blood (Exodus 24:8)

**Covenant with David** (2 Samuel 7):
- Promise of eternal throne
- God commits to David's line forever
- Even judgment won't end the covenant (unlike Saul)

**New Covenant** (Jeremiah 31, Christian fulfillment in Christ):
- Written on hearts, not stone
- Inward transformation, direct knowledge of God
- "They will all know Me" (Jeremiah 31:34)

Covenant language is relational, not categorical:
- "I am your God" (not "I am the Supreme Being")
- "You are my people" (not "You are rational souls")
- "I will never leave you" (not "I possess the attribute of faithfulness")

You cannot know God in covenant while treating Him as an object of study. Covenant demands engagement, faithfulness, response. You know your covenant partner by *living* the relationship, not by cataloging their properties.

# The Tension

Can both be true? Can God be:
- Eternal essence *and* active participant in history?
- Unchanging being *and* responsive covenant partner?
- Impassible perfection *and* grieving Father?
- Defined by attributes *and* known through relationship?

Greek theology fears: If God changes, responds, grieves, isn't He dependent on creation? Doesn't that compromise His perfection?

Hebrew theology fears: If God is static essence, how can He truly love? Love requires vulnerability, responsiveness, the freedom to be affected by the beloved.

The church has wrestled with this for two millennia. Church fathers, trained in Greek philosophy, sought to reconcile the God of the philosophers with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They crafted doctrines of divine simplicity, immutability, impassibility—trying to honor both transcendence and intimacy.

But the question remains: **Is the synthesis coherent? Or must we choose between the God who IS and the God who ACTS?**

Judaism never attempted the synthesis. It preserved narrative, multiplied interpretations, embraced paradox. The Talmud records centuries of rabbis arguing, offering competing views, leaving tensions unresolved. *Eilu v'eilu*—"These and these are both the words of the living God."

Christian systematic theology, inheriting Greek method, seeks resolution. But perhaps the tension is the point. Perhaps we know God most truly when we refuse to flatten Him into either system alone.

We encounter the God who declares "I AM WHO I AM"—essence and presence, being and becoming, eternal and entering time.

The Living God.
