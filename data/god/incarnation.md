Eternal God in time. How?

**Biblical data:** "The Word was God" (John 1:1) and "The Word became flesh" (John 1:14).
**Philosophical problem:** If God is eternal, immutable, impassible—how can He become human, suffer, and die?

**Classical solution:** Hypostatic Union (Chalcedon, 451 AD)—Christ is one person with two natures (divine and human), united without mixture or separation. The divine nature remains unchanging; the human nature experiences time and suffering.

**The tension:** Scripture doesn't say "the human nature died"—it says "*Christ* died" (Romans 5:8). Did God truly suffer, or did we protect Greek philosophy at the Gospel's expense?

# Eternal God in Time

The Incarnation is Christianity's most scandalous claim: The eternal, infinite, unchanging God became a finite, temporal, suffering human being.

Greek philosophy recoils. How can the immutable change? How can the impassible suffer? How can God fit into a human body?

Yet Scripture insists: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14). God didn't just appear human (Docetism)—He *became* human. Truly born, truly hungry, truly suffering, truly dead.

## The Biblical Data

The New Testament proclaims both full deity and full humanity of Christ:

**Full Deity:**
- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1)
- "He is the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15)
- Thomas worships Jesus: "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28)
- "In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form" (Colossians 2:9)
- Jesus claims divine prerogatives: forgiving sins (Mark 2:5-7), receiving worship (Matthew 14:33), existing before Abraham (John 8:58)

**Full Humanity:**
- Born of a woman (Galatians 4:4)
- Grew in wisdom and stature (Luke 2:52)
- Hungry, thirsty, tired (Matthew 4:2, John 4:6-7, John 19:28)
- Experienced temptation (Hebrews 4:15)
- Wept (John 11:35)
- Suffered, bled, died (Mark 15:37)
- Rose bodily from the dead (Luke 24:39—"a ghost does not have flesh and bones")

**The Union:**
- "The Word became flesh" (John 1:14)—not "appeared as" but *became*
- "He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men" (Philippians 2:7)
- One person with two natures: "For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5)

## The Philosophical Problem

Greek philosophy's God cannot become incarnate:

**Immutability:**
- God does not change (Malachi 3:6)
- Becoming human is change
- How can the unchanging change?

**Impassibility:**
- God is not affected by creation, does not suffer
- Jesus suffers on the cross
- How can the impassible suffer?

**Infinity:**
- God is infinite, unbounded
- A human body is finite, limited
- How can the infinite be contained in the finite?

**Simplicity:**
- God has no parts, no composition
- But now Christ has a divine nature *and* a human nature
- How can the simple become composite?

If we protect these philosophical attributes, the Incarnation becomes incoherent. If we affirm the Incarnation, these attributes seem violated.

## The Classical Solution: Hypostatic Union

The Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) formulated the orthodox position:

**One Person, Two Natures:**
- Christ is *one person* (the eternal Son)
- With *two natures* (divine and human)
- The natures are united in one person

**Four Negatives:**
The union is:
- *Without mixture* (the natures don't blend into a third thing)
- *Without change* (the divine nature doesn't become human; the human doesn't become divine)
- *Without division* (they're not two separate persons)
- *Without separation* (you can't divide Christ into God-part and human-part)

**How It Works:**
- The divine *nature* possesses divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, eternity, immutability)
- The human *nature* possesses human attributes (finitude, growth, suffering, mortality)
- The *person* of the Son experiences both natures
- When Christ dies, the human nature dies; the divine nature remains unchanging

**Communicatio Idiomatum** (Communication of Properties):
- Because the two natures are united in one person, what is true of one nature can be said of the person
- "God died" (the person who is God died in His human nature)
- "This man created the world" (the person who is man is also the Creator)

## The Strength: Guarding Orthodoxy

Chalcedon protects essential truths:

**Against Arianism:**
- Christ is fully God, not a lesser deity or exalted creature
- Only God can save; if Christ isn't God, we're not saved

**Against Apollinarianism:**
- Christ has a full human nature, including a human mind/soul
- He's not God in a human body, but truly man

**Against Nestorianism:**
- Christ is one person, not two persons loosely connected
- Mary is *Theotokos* (God-bearer), not just mother of the human Jesus

**Against Eutychianism:**
- The two natures remain distinct, not blended into a hybrid

**Protecting Atonement:**
- Christ must be fully God to make His sacrifice infinite in value
- Christ must be fully human to represent us, die in our place
- The union is essential to salvation

## The Tension: Greek Categories and Biblical Claim

But does the formulation *capture* the biblical claim, or does it *tame* it to fit Greek philosophy?

### Did God Suffer?

Classical theism: God is impassible—He doesn't suffer. The divine nature cannot be affected by creation.

Chalcedon's move: The human nature suffered; the divine nature remained impassible.

But Scripture doesn't say "the human nature of Christ died." It says "*Christ* died" (Romans 5:8). The *person* suffered—the Son of God.

If we insist the divine nature didn't suffer, did *God* really enter our suffering? Or did a human nature attached to God suffer while God remained untouched?

The Gospel proclaims: God loved us so much that He *Himself* bore our sin, experienced our death, tasted our separation from the Father. "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matthew 27:46)—God cries to God.

Does the two-natures framework preserve this—or does it protect Greek impassibility at the expense of the Gospel's scandal?

### Did God Change?

Classical theism: God is immutable—He doesn't change in essence, will, or knowledge.

Chalcedon's move: The divine nature didn't change; the Son *assumed* a human nature.

But if the Son goes from "not-incarnate" to "incarnate," isn't that change? He wasn't human before the virgin birth; He became human. That's a change of state.

The classical response: The divine nature didn't change; the change happened in the human nature's relation to the divine. God didn't become different; the humanity was added to God.

But this feels like verbal gymnastics. The *Son* experienced something new. He who was only divine took on humanity. He who didn't have a body now has one forever (even in His resurrection and ascension).

If we protect immutability so strongly, do we undermine the reality of the Incarnation?

### The Finite and the Infinite

How can the infinite God be contained in a finite human?

Chalcedon doesn't really answer—it affirms the union without explaining the "how."

Later theologians developed concepts like:
- *Extra Calvinisticum*: The Son's divine nature extends beyond the human body (He's still omnipresent while on earth)
- *Kenosis* (Philippians 2:7): The Son "emptied Himself"—but of what? Not of deity (He's still fully God), but perhaps of the independent use of divine attributes?

These are attempts to explain. But do they succeed—or do they show that Greek categories strain under the weight of biblical revelation?

## The Hebrew Mystery

Judaism finds the Incarnation scandalous—God cannot become human. It violates divine transcendence.

But Christianity insists: God can do what seems impossible. The Incarnation is not a logical deduction from Greek philosophy—it's a shocking event in history.

Perhaps we approach it wrongly when we try to make it philosophically coherent. Perhaps the Incarnation *breaks* our categories rather than fitting into them.

### Incarnation as Event, Not Explanation

Hebrew thought emphasizes *what happened* over *how it's possible*:
- The Word became flesh (event)
- Born of a virgin (event)
- Suffered under Pontius Pilate (event)
- Rose on the third day (event)

The Creeds narrate events more than they explain mechanisms. "Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead."

This is testimony, not systematic theology. *This happened*—whether or not we can fit it into Greek metaphysics.

### The Scandal Preserved

Maybe the Incarnation is meant to *shatter* our philosophical assumptions about God:
- God can enter time without ceasing to be eternal
- God can suffer without ceasing to be perfect
- God can be limited in a body without ceasing to be infinite

Not because we can explain how—but because He did it.

The Incarnation doesn't fit Greek categories because Greek categories were never adequate for the Living God. The God of the Bible is not the God of the philosophers. He is the God who becomes flesh, who suffers, who dies, who rises.

## Worship, Not Just Definition

Ultimately, the Incarnation is mystery—truth we confess without fully comprehending.

We don't worship the Chalcedonian Definition (though it guards truth). We worship the incarnate Son:
- "Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; hail the incarnate Deity"
- "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory"

Chalcedon helps us think clearly. But it doesn't exhaust the reality. The Son's taking on flesh is an act of love beyond logic, grace beyond reason, glory beyond comprehension.

Perhaps that's the point. The Living God cannot be contained in our categories—even the orthodox ones. He breaks through, enters history, becomes one of us.

"No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known" (John 1:18).

God made known—not through philosophical definition, but through a person. Through flesh, blood, suffering, death, resurrection.

The Word made flesh. Mystery and miracle. Scandal and salvation.
