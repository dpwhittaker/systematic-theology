[God](#god/god 'Parent')

Hebrew theology is inseparable from history. God reveals His character through what He *does*.

Key [events](#intro/narrative 'Hebrew'):
- *Creation*: Speaking the world into being, forming humanity in His image (Genesis 1-2).
- *Call of Abraham*: Choosing one man to bless all nations (Genesis 12).
- *Exodus*: Delivering Israel from slavery, the foundational event of Jewish identity (Exodus 1-15).
- *Giving Torah*: Meeting Israel at Sinai, establishing [covenant](#god/covenants 'Hebrew') (Exodus 19-20).
- *Presence*: Dwelling among His people in fire and cloud, Tabernacle and Temple.
- *Incarnation*: God becomes flesh in Jesus Christ, the ultimate act—entering creation, suffering, dying, rising.

In Hebrew thought, these acts are not *illustrations* of pre-existing [attributes](#god/attributes 'Greek'). They *are* the revelation.
We don't say "God delivered Israel because He has the attribute of being a deliverer."
We say "God *is* a deliverer because He delivered Israel."

# God Known Through Deeds

Greek philosophy asks: What is God's timeless, unchanging essence?

Hebrew Scripture answers: Look at what God *did*—and you'll know who He is.

The Bible is not a systematic theology textbook. It's a story—God's acts in history. Creation, call, deliverance, covenant, judgment, redemption. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the God who *acts*, and His character is revealed through His deeds.

## Creation: Speaking Into Existence

**"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"** (Genesis 1:1)

The first act: Creation by divine word.

**What It Reveals:**

*Power*: God speaks, and galaxies form. No struggle, no resistance. "Let there be light"—and there is light (Genesis 1:3).

*Intentionality*: Creation is ordered, purposeful. Six days of separation and filling—light from darkness, sea from land, day from night. Everything in its place.

*Creativity*: Astonishing variety—stars and sea creatures, mountains and mustard seeds. God is not minimalist; He is lavish, delighting in diversity.

*Desire for Relationship*: The climax is humanity, made in God's image (Genesis 1:27). Not robots or slaves, but image-bearers—creatures capable of knowing and loving their Creator.

*Rest*: God rests on the seventh day (Genesis 2:2-3). Not from exhaustion, but to establish rhythm, to hallow time. Sabbath is built into creation—rest is sacred.

**The Difference from Attributes:**
We could say "God is omnipotent" (attribute). But Creation reveals *how* God wields power—not as tyrant, but as artist. Not coercive, but creative. Spoken into being, not forced.

The act reveals something the abstract attribute doesn't: God's *delight* in creation. "God saw that it was good" (Genesis 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25)—and "very good" (Genesis 1:31). This is not cold causation; this is pleased Creator beholding His handiwork.

## Call of Abraham: Choosing for Blessing

**"Go from your country... to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation"** (Genesis 12:1-2)

God singles out one man from all humanity. Not because Abraham is righteous (he's not—see Genesis 12, where he lies about Sarah). Not because he deserves it. Simply because God *chooses*.

**What It Reveals:**

*Initiative*: God acts first. Abraham doesn't seek God; God calls Abraham.

*Grace*: The call is unearned. Abraham receives promises, not because of merit, but because of God's free decision to love him.

*Faithfulness*: God makes promises—descendants, land, blessing—and keeps them across generations. Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Israel.

*Mission*: God blesses Abraham to bless "all peoples on earth" (Genesis 12:3). Particularity serves universality. God chooses one to reach all.

**The Scandal:**
Why Abraham? Why Isaac and not Ishmael? Why Jacob and not Esau? Scripture doesn't explain. It narrates. God chooses—and His choosing reveals that relationship with God is gift, not achievement.

This is the God who says "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy" (Exodus 33:19, Romans 9:15). Not arbitrary, but sovereign. Not explained by human categories of fairness, but grounded in God's own purposes.

## Exodus: Deliverance from Slavery

**"I have seen the misery of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out... and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down to rescue them"** (Exodus 3:7-8)

The foundational event of Jewish identity. God delivers Israel from Egypt with mighty acts—ten plagues, parting the Red Sea, drowning Pharaoh's army.

**What It Reveals:**

*Compassion*: God *sees* their suffering, *hears* their cries, is *concerned*. This is not detached observation. This is emotional engagement.

*Justice*: God judges oppressors. Pharaoh enslaves, so Pharaoh is overthrown. God sides with the weak against the powerful.

*Power Over Empires*: Egypt is the superpower of the ancient world. God defeats it with plagues that mock Egypt's gods—the Nile (turned to blood), the sun (darkened), Pharaoh's heir (killed). YHWH is sovereign over all.

*Loyalty to His Covenant*: God acts "because of My covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (Exodus 2:24). He remembers, He keeps faith, He fulfills promises.

**The Memory:**
Jews recite this event every Passover. "We were slaves in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out with a mighty hand." Not "our ancestors" but "*we*"—the past is present, the story is identity.

God is known as "YHWH who brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2). His identity is tied to this act. It's not just something He did once—it's *who He is*. Deliverer.

## Giving Torah: Covenant Instruction

**"I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt... You shall have no other gods before Me"** (Exodus 20:2-3)

After deliverance, God meets Israel at Sinai. Fire, smoke, thunder, trumpet blast. The mountain shakes. God descends, speaks the Ten Commandments, and establishes covenant.

**What It Reveals:**

*Holiness*: God is dangerous. The people must not touch the mountain or they die (Exodus 19:12). He is not safe, not domesticated. He is holy fire.

*Desire for Relationship*: Despite His holiness, He wants to dwell among them. "Make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8).

*Care for How They Live*: God doesn't just rescue and leave. He gives Torah—instructions for worship, justice, purity, community. He cares about all of life.

*Faithfulness to His Character*: The Law reflects God's nature. "Be holy, because I am holy" (Leviticus 11:45). Imitate Me. Live like your Father.

**The Pattern:**
Grace precedes law. "I brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2) comes *before* "You shall..." (Exodus 20:3-17). Salvation first, then instruction. Relationship established, then how to live in it.

This is not "obey to earn God's favor." This is "you're My people—here's how My people live."

## Presence: Dwelling Among His People

**"The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle"** (Exodus 40:34)

God doesn't stay distant. He dwells among Israel—first in the tabernacle (portable tent), later in the temple (Solomon's building in Jerusalem).

**What It Reveals:**

*Immanence*: God is not far away. He camps in the center of their camp (Numbers 2). He travels with them.

*Holiness and Access*: The Most Holy Place is veiled (Exodus 26:33). Only the high priest enters, once a year, with blood. God is present, but approach carefully.

*Faithfulness*: Even when Israel rebels, God's presence remains (though it does depart in Ezekiel 10-11 during the exile, and later returns in the vision of Ezekiel 40-48).

**The Trajectory:**
Tabernacle → Temple → Incarnation. God's presence becomes more intimate: dwelling *among* → dwelling *in* (the Holy Spirit) → dwelling *as* (Jesus Christ).

"The Word became flesh and *tabernacled* among us" (John 1:14, literal translation). Jesus is the ultimate presence—God not in a building but in a body.

## Judgment and Exile: When God Acts in Wrath

God also judges. He sends Israel into exile (Assyria conquers the northern kingdom, Babylon conquers Judah). Jerusalem falls, the temple is destroyed.

**What It Reveals:**

*Justice*: God does not overlook sin. He warned repeatedly through the prophets. Persistent rebellion brings consequences.

*Grief*: God doesn't judge coldly. "How can I give you up, Ephraim?" (Hosea 11:8). He is torn, suffering over His people's destruction.

*Covenant Faithfulness Even in Judgment*: Exile is not abandonment. God promises restoration (Jeremiah 29:10-14). He will bring them back, renew the covenant, write it on their hearts.

**The Tension:**
How can God be both just (punishing sin) and merciful (restoring sinners)? The cross answers: God judges sin fully (Jesus bears it) and extends mercy fully (forgiveness through Christ's sacrifice).

## Incarnation: God Becomes Flesh

**"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us"** (John 1:14)

The ultimate act: God enters creation. The eternal Son takes on human nature, is born as a baby, lives, suffers, dies, rises.

**What It Reveals:**

*Love*: "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son" (John 3:16). Not abstract benevolence—costly, sacrificial, vulnerable love.

*Humility*: "He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant" (Philippians 2:7). The Creator becomes creature. The infinite becomes finite. The eternal enters time.

*Solidarity*: "We do not have a high priest unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are" (Hebrews 4:15). God knows human suffering from the inside.

*Victory Over Death*: Jesus rises from the dead. The curse of sin—death—is defeated. God acts to accomplish what no human could.

**The Scandal:**
God doesn't rescue humanity from a distance. He doesn't just forgive sins by decree. He becomes human, lives under the law, fulfills it perfectly, bears the penalty for sin in His own body, and defeats death by dying and rising.

This is not the God of the philosophers—impassible, unchanging, outside time. This is the God who *acts*, who enters history, who suffers and saves.

## The Difference: Act vs. Attribute

Greek theology says: "God has the attribute of love. He loves because love is part of His essence."

Hebrew theology says: "God loved us. How do we know? He delivered us from Egypt. He gave His Son. Look at what He *did*."

The difference:
- **Attribute**: Timeless, abstract, universal
- **Act**: Historical, concrete, particular

We gain clarity from attributes. But we gain *encounter* from acts. We see not just *what* God is, but *who* God is—the One who acts in history, who intervenes, who saves.

And we learn that God's character is not just essence to be contemplated, but action to be experienced. He is the God who delivers, who makes covenants, who becomes flesh.

The Living God, known through His mighty deeds.
