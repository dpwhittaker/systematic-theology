[God](#god/god 'Parent')
---
God binds Himself to His people through *berith* (covenant)—not a [contract](#intro/philosophy 'Greek'), but a family bond sealed by oath and blood.

Major covenants:
- *Abraham*: Unconditional promise of descendants, land, blessing (Genesis 12, 15, 17).
- *Sinai*: "I will be your God; you will be My people" (Exodus 19-24).
- *David*: Eternal throne, God's commitment to David's line (2 Samuel 7).
- *New Covenant*: Written on hearts, direct knowledge of God (Jeremiah 31, fulfilled in Christ).

Covenant language is [relational](#intro/relation 'Hebrew'), not categorical: "I am *your* God" (not "I am the Supreme Being").
You cannot know God in covenant while treating Him as an object of study.

# Relationship Over Definition

The God of the Bible doesn't merely have attributes—He makes *covenants*. He binds Himself in relationship, commits Himself by oath, seals promises in blood.

This is fundamentally relational knowing. You don't know your covenant partner by cataloging their properties. You know them by *living* the relationship—by faithfulness, trust, shared history.

## Covenant vs. Contract

The Hebrew *berith* (covenant) is fundamentally different from a Greek legal contract. Where contracts are transactional and conditional, covenants create family bonds based on committed love. God doesn't negotiate terms with Israel—He adopts them as children, binds Himself to them in blood oath (Genesis 15), and remains faithful even when they break covenant (Hosea).

For comprehensive discussion of covenant vs contract distinction, see [Covenant & Relation](#intro/relation#covenant-vs-contract 'Hebrew').

## Covenant with Abraham: Unconditional Promise

**"I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you"** (Genesis 12:2)

God's covenant with Abraham is foundational to the entire biblical story:

**The Promises:**
- Descendants numerous as the stars (Genesis 15:5)
- Land for his offspring (Genesis 15:18)
- Blessing to all nations through his seed (Genesis 12:3)

**The Sealing:**
Genesis 15 records a stunning ritual. Abraham cuts animals in two and lays the pieces opposite each other. In ancient covenant-making, both parties would walk between the pieces, invoking on themselves the fate of the animals if they break the covenant: "May I be torn apart like this if I violate this oath."

But in Genesis 15:17, only God—represented by a smoking firepot and flaming torch—passes between the pieces. Abraham is asleep. God alone takes the oath.

This is *unilateral covenant*. God binds Himself. Abraham receives the promise. If anyone is torn apart for covenant violation, it will be God.

**The Sign:**
Circumcision (Genesis 17:10-14) marks covenant members in their own flesh. A permanent, painful, intimate sign. Not external decoration but identity carved into the body.

This is not a contract Abraham can walk away from. It's family identity, passed to his children, binding them into the story God is writing.

## Covenant at Sinai: "I Will Be Your God"

**"You shall be My treasured possession among all peoples... a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"** (Exodus 19:5-6)

After delivering Israel from Egypt, God makes covenant with the whole nation at Mount Sinai.

**The Formula:**
"I will be your God; you will be My people" (Leviticus 26:12, Jeremiah 7:23, and throughout Scripture).

This is *relational* language:
- Not "I am the Supreme Being" but "I am *your* God"
- Not "You are rational souls" but "You are *My* people"
- Belonging, not categorization

**The Law:**
The Ten Commandments and the rest of Torah are not conditions for earning God's favor. God *already* delivered them from Egypt (Exodus 20:2). The Law is covenant instruction—how to live as God's people, how to reflect His character, how to maintain the relationship.

It's like marriage: The vows come first ("I will be your husband; you will be my wife"), then the couple learns how to live together. The instructions aren't conditions to become family—they're how family flourishes.

**The Sealing:**
Exodus 24:8—Moses takes blood from sacrifices and sprinkles it on the people, saying "This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you."

Blood signifies life (Leviticus 17:11). Sharing blood creates kinship. This is not a legal transaction—it's a blood oath, binding God and Israel as family.

## Covenant with David: Eternal Throne

**"Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before Me; your throne shall be established forever"** (2 Samuel 7:16)

David wants to build God a house (temple). God responds: I'll build *you* a house (dynasty).

**The Promise:**
- David's line will rule Israel forever
- Even when his descendants sin, God will discipline but not remove His covenant love
- Unlike Saul (whose kingdom was taken away), David's throne is secure

**The Fulfillment:**
Christians see this fulfilled in Jesus, the "son of David" (Matthew 1:1), whose kingdom is eternal. The covenant is not revoked—it's brought to its intended climax.

**The Contrast:**
Saul's kingship was conditional: obey, or lose the throne. David's is covenant: God commits Himself regardless of David's (or his sons') failures.

This is grace. Not earned, not deserved, not maintained by human faithfulness. God keeps covenant even when His partner doesn't.

## New Covenant: Written on Hearts

**"I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel... I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts"** (Jeremiah 31:31-33)

Jeremiah prophesies a covenant that surpasses Sinai:

**The Difference:**
- Old: External law on stone tablets
- New: Internal law written on hearts
- Old: Mediated by priests
- New: Direct knowledge—"They shall all know Me" (Jeremiah 31:34)
- Old: Broken by Israel's unfaithfulness
- New: Kept by God's transforming power

**The Fulfillment:**
Jesus at the Last Supper: "This cup is the new covenant in My blood" (Luke 22:20, 1 Corinthians 11:25).

The covenant is sealed not with animal blood but with Christ's blood. Not external compliance but internal transformation. Not Israel only but all who believe (Jew and Gentile).

The Spirit writes God's law on hearts (2 Corinthians 3:3). Believers are given new hearts that desire God (Ezekiel 36:26). The covenant relationship becomes internalized, personal, unbreakable.

## Covenant Knowing vs. Categorical Knowing

Greek philosophy knows God by *studying* Him—observing, defining, cataloging attributes. This is third-person knowledge: "God is X."

Hebrew covenant knows God by *belonging* to Him—living in relationship, obeying, trusting, worshiping. This is second-person knowledge: "*You* are my God."

The difference:
- You can study God without loving Him
- You can list His attributes without trusting Him
- You can pass a theology exam without knowing Him personally

But you cannot be in covenant with God while remaining detached. Covenant demands engagement, faithfulness, response.

## God's Covenant Faithfulness

The stunning thing about biblical covenants: God keeps them even when His partners don't.

Israel breaks covenant repeatedly—idolatry, injustice, rebellion. By contract terms, God could void the agreement. But He doesn't.

Instead:
- He *grieves* over their unfaithfulness (Genesis 6:6, Jeremiah 3:20)
- He *pursues* them like a betrayed spouse (Hosea)
- He *disciplines* them as a father (Hebrews 12:6)
- He *renews* the covenant despite their failure (Jeremiah 31)

This is not the impassible God of Greek philosophy, untouched by creation. This is the covenant God who *binds Himself* vulnerably, who suffers betrayal, who refuses to let go.

Hosea embodies this: God commands him to marry a prostitute who will be unfaithful, then to take her back. The prophet's pain reveals God's pain. Covenant love is not abstract benevolence—it's the fierce, suffering, unrelenting devotion of a spouse who will not abandon the beloved.

## Covenant and the Gospel

The Gospel is covenant language through and through:
- Christ is the mediator of a new covenant (Hebrews 9:15)
- His blood seals the covenant (Matthew 26:28)
- Believers are adopted as children (Galatians 4:5)
- We are betrothed to Christ as a bride (Ephesians 5:25-32)

This is not legal fiction or mere metaphor. This is *family*. God doesn't just forgive our sins and remain at a distance. He brings us into covenant relationship—making us His own, giving us His name, writing His law on our hearts, promising never to leave or forsake us.

To know God is to be in covenant with Him. Not to define His essence from a distance, but to belong to Him, to be loved by Him, to live in the bond He has sealed with His own blood.
