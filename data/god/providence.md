God governs all things, yet evil persists. Why?

**Biblical data:** "Not a sparrow falls apart from your Father's care" (Matthew 10:29) and "My God, why have You forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1).
**Philosophical problem:** If God is good and sovereign, why does evil exist? Why do the innocent suffer?

**Classical theodicies:**
- *Free will*: Evil results from human misuse of freedom.
- *Soul-making*: Suffering builds character and virtue.
- *Mystery*: God's purposes exceed our understanding.

**The tension:** These treat evil as an intellectual puzzle to solve. Scripture treats it as existential reality to lament, fight, and trust God through.

# God's Governance and the Reality of Evil

If God is both all-powerful and all-good, why does evil exist? This is the problem of theodicy—defending God's goodness in the face of suffering.

Greek philosophy treats it as a logical problem: How do we reconcile three propositions?
1. God is all-powerful (omnipotent)
2. God is all-good (benevolent)
3. Evil exists

If all three are true, there seems to be a contradiction. Classical theism developed explanations—theodicies—to resolve it.

## The Biblical Data

Scripture affirms both God's providential control and the reality of suffering:

**Providence:**
- "The Lord works out everything to its proper end—even the wicked for a day of disaster" (Proverbs 16:4)
- "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care" (Matthew 10:29)
- "In all things God works for the good of those who love Him" (Romans 8:28)
- God governs nature, nations, individual lives

**Suffering:**
- "How long, O Lord? Will You forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1)
- "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1, quoted by Jesus on the cross)
- Job suffers catastrophic loss despite being "blameless and upright" (Job 1:1)
- The righteous are martyred; the wicked prosper (Psalm 73)

How can both be true? If God governs all things, why doesn't He prevent suffering?

## Classical Theodicies

Christian theology developed several explanations:

### The Free Will Defense

**The Argument:**
- God gave humans free will—the ability to choose between good and evil
- Genuine love and obedience require freedom; coerced love isn't love
- Moral evil (sin, violence, cruelty) results from human misuse of freedom
- God could eliminate evil only by eliminating freedom—which would eliminate the greater good of genuine relationship

**Strengths:**
- Explains moral evil (murder, theft, betrayal) as human responsibility
- Preserves God's goodness—He's not the author of sin
- Aligns with Scripture's emphasis on human choice and accountability

**Weaknesses:**
- What about natural evil (earthquakes, disease, childhood cancer)?
- If God foreknows we'll misuse freedom, why create us?
- Does libertarian freedom (the ability to choose otherwise) actually exist, given divine sovereignty?

### The Soul-Making Theodicy

**The Argument:**
- This world is not a paradise but a place for spiritual development
- Suffering builds character, faith, perseverance, compassion
- A world without challenges wouldn't produce mature souls
- God permits suffering for the greater good of forming us into His image

**Strengths:**
- Explains why God allows difficulty even for believers
- Fits passages like Romans 5:3-4 ("suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character")
- Provides meaning to suffering—it's not pointless

**Weaknesses:**
- What about suffering that destroys rather than builds (trauma, mental illness)?
- What about children who die before "soul-making" can occur?
- Does this make God a utilitarian—using suffering as a tool?

### The Greater Good Defense

**The Argument:**
- God permits lesser evils to achieve greater goods that wouldn't be possible otherwise
- Example: The crucifixion was the worst evil (killing the Son of God), yet it accomplished the greatest good (redemption)
- We can't see the full picture; what seems evil to us may serve purposes we don't comprehend

**Strengths:**
- Explains how God can be sovereign over events that seem evil
- Provides hope that suffering isn't meaningless
- Aligns with Romans 8:28 ("all things work together for good")

**Weaknesses:**
- Can sound dismissive to those in pain ("It's all for a greater good you can't see")
- Does the end justify the means? Can any good justify the Holocaust, genocide, rape?
- Risks making God's goodness incomprehensible—if His "good" allows this, how is it good?

### The Mystery Defense

**The Argument:**
- We are finite; God is infinite
- We can't comprehend all His purposes
- Trust that God is good even when we don't understand
- "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways" (Isaiah 55:8)

**Strengths:**
- Humble—admits our limits
- Doesn't claim to explain what may be inexplicable
- Calls for faith, not just logic

**Weaknesses:**
- Can feel like giving up on the question
- Risks making God arbitrary—if we can't understand His goodness, how do we know He's good?
- Doesn't engage the real pain of sufferers

## The Problem with Theodicies

All these approaches share a common assumption: Evil is an *intellectual problem* to be solved through Greek reasoning. If we think hard enough, we can explain why God permits suffering in a way that logically reconciles His power and goodness.

But Scripture doesn't treat evil this way.

### Job: No Answer, Only Presence

Job is the Bible's sustained meditation on suffering. Job loses his children, his wealth, his health. His friends insist he must have sinned—suffering is always punishment. Job protests his innocence.

At the end, God speaks—but He doesn't *explain*. He doesn't say:
- "I allowed this to test your faith" (soul-making)
- "Satan did this, not Me" (dualism)
- "It will all make sense someday" (greater good)

Instead, God asks: "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation?" (Job 38:4). He displays His power, wisdom, and majesty. He shows Job the vastness of creation—behemoth, leviathan, the stars.

Job's response: "I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know... My ears had heard of You but now my eyes have seen You" (Job 42:3, 5).

God doesn't give a theodicy. He gives Himself. And somehow, that's enough.

### The Psalms: Lament, Not Explanation

The Psalms don't offer philosophical explanations for suffering. They *cry out*:
- "How long, O Lord?" (Psalm 13)
- "Why do You stand far off?" (Psalm 10)
- "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" (Psalm 22)

This is not resolution—it's *lament*. Honest, raw, unfiltered pain brought before God.

And God includes these in Scripture. The Holy Spirit inspired lament. God doesn't rebuke those who cry out—He invites it.

Hebrew faith doesn't resolve the tension between God's goodness and the world's suffering. It *lives in* the tension, trusting God even in darkness.

### Jesus: God Enters Suffering

The ultimate answer to evil is not an explanation but an event: the Incarnation and crucifixion.

God doesn't solve the problem of suffering from a distance. He *enters* it. The Son becomes human, experiences betrayal, torture, death. "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matthew 27:46)—God cries out to God.

This doesn't explain *why* evil exists. But it shows that God is not detached. He doesn't stand outside our pain, observing. He enters it, bears it, defeats it.

The resurrection is God's answer to evil—not an explanation, but a victory. Death is conquered. Suffering will not have the final word.

## The Hebrew Alternative

Perhaps the demand for systematic explanation is itself the Greek imposition.

Greek philosophy wants *answers*. Why does evil exist? How can God be good if suffering happens? Solve the puzzle.

Hebrew faith wants *faithfulness*. Can we trust God even when we don't understand? Can we lament honestly yet still worship? Can we fight evil while trusting God's sovereignty?

The difference:
- Theodicies treat evil as a problem to *solve*
- Scripture treats evil as a reality to *lament, resist, and trust God through*

Theodicies seek intellectual coherence. Scripture seeks covenant faithfulness.

## Living in the Tension

Perhaps we must hold both without collapsing either:

**God is sovereign:**
- Nothing happens outside His governance
- His plans will not be thwarted
- He will bring good out of all things for those who love Him

**Evil is real:**
- It is not an illusion or a "lesser good"
- It should be lamented, fought, grieved
- We do not understand why God permits it

We trust God's goodness even when we can't explain His ways. We cry out in pain even while we worship. We resist evil even while we trust God's sovereignty over it.

This is not philosophical resolution. It's faith.

Perhaps that's the point. The God of the Bible is not a philosophical puzzle to solve but a Father to trust—even in the darkest valley.

"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him" (Job 13:15).
