title: Reconciling Philosophy and Revelation
shortTitle: Reconciliation
---
[God](#god/god 'Parent')
---
Classical theism meets biblical revelation. Can they coexist?

The God of [essence](#god/essence 'Greek') and [attributes](#god/attributes 'Greek'): unchanging, impassible, eternal, simple.
The God of the Bible: grieves, relents, becomes flesh, suffers, dies.

Christian theology developed doctrines to reconcile these tensions:

**Core Reconciliations:**
- [Father, Son, Spirit](#god/trinity 'Drill'): Biblical language vs. Greek "three persons, one essence"—is philosophical precision necessary?
- [Incarnation](#jesus/incarnation 'Drill'): Eternal God in time—the Son filled with the Spirit became flesh. Greek "hypostatic union" language vs. Hebrew testimony.
- [Impassibility](#god/impassibility 'Drill'): Can God suffer, or is He unchangingly perfect?

**Providence and Freedom:**
- [Sovereignty](#god/sovereignty 'Drill'): Divine control and human freedom—Calvinism, Arminianism, Molinism.
- [Providence](#god/providence 'Drill'): God's governance and the reality of evil—theodicies and lament.

The question: Are these successful syntheses, or do they reveal an irresolvable conflict between Greek thought and Hebrew revelation?

Perhaps the tension is the point. Perhaps the Living God cannot be captured by any system—even the orthodox ones.
