title: Reconciling Philosophy and Revelation
shortTitle: Reconciliation
---
[God](#god/god 'Parent')
---
Classical theism meets biblical revelation. Can they coexist?

The God of [essence](#god/essence 'Greek') and [attributes](#god/attributes 'Greek') is unchanging, impassible, eternal.
But the Bible shows God who *grieves*, *relents*, *becomes flesh*.

Christian theology developed doctrines to reconcile these tensions:
- *Trinity*: One [essence](#god/essence 'Greek'), three persons—preserving unity while honoring Father, Son, Spirit.
- *Sovereignty*: God's absolute control balanced with human freedom and responsibility.
- *Providence*: God's governance of all things while evil and suffering persist.

Are these successful [syntheses](#intro/philosophy 'Greek'), or do they reveal an irresolvable conflict between Greek thought and Hebrew revelation?

# The Problem of Synthesis

Early Christian theologians faced a profound challenge: How do we speak truthfully about the God revealed in Scripture using the philosophical tools of Greek thought?

The God of the Bible:
- Speaks, acts, enters history
- Grieves over sin, delights in obedience
- Becomes flesh in Jesus Christ
- Wrestles with Jacob, walks with Adam, argues with Abraham

The God of classical philosophy:
- Eternal, outside time
- Immutable, unchanging
- Impassible, unaffected by creation
- Simple, without parts or complexity

These seem incompatible. Can the same God be both eternal and temporal? Unchanging and responsive? Impassible and suffering?

Christian theology developed complex doctrines to reconcile these tensions. But do they succeed—or do they reveal that Greek categories cannot contain Hebrew revelation?

## Trinity: One Essence, Three Persons

**The Biblical Data:**
- "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4)
- The Father sends the Son (John 3:16)
- The Son prays to the Father (John 17)
- The Spirit proceeds from the Father (John 15:26)
- "Baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19)

**The Philosophical Problem:**
If God is one (monotheism), how can Father, Son, and Spirit all be God without being three Gods?

**The Classical Solution:**
The church formulated the doctrine of the Trinity:
- One *essence* (ousia)
- Three *persons* (hypostases)
- Each person is fully God, not one-third of God
- The persons are distinguished by their relations to one another

This is a Greek philosophical move: abstract to *essence* (what God is), then distinguish *persons* (who exists in that essence). God's essence is simple and one; His personal existence is threefold.

**The Strength:**
- Preserves monotheism (one God)
- Honors biblical revelation (Father, Son, Spirit are all addressed as God)
- Provides precise language to combat heresy (modalism, tritheism, Arianism)

**The Tension:**
Does the concept of "person" in Greek philosophy (hypostasis) match the biblical portrayal of Father, Son, and Spirit? Are they three "centers of consciousness" or three "modes of existence" or something else entirely?

And if we say God's *essence* is simple and unchanging, but the Son becomes incarnate and dies, have we split God into essence (which doesn't change) and person (which does)? Have we protected Greek philosophy at the expense of biblical narrative?

## Sovereignty: Divine Control and Human Freedom

**The Biblical Data:**
- "The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all" (Psalm 103:19)
- "In Him we were chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will" (Ephesians 1:11)
- "Choose this day whom you will serve" (Joshua 24:15)
- "Whoever believes in Him shall not perish" (John 3:16)

**The Philosophical Problem:**
If God is sovereign (controls all things), are humans truly free? If humans are free, is God truly sovereign?

**Attempted Solutions:**

*Calvinism* emphasizes sovereignty:
- God's will is always accomplished
- He ordains all things, including human choices
- Humans are free in the sense that they choose according to their desires, but those desires are determined by God's decree
- Election and predestination are absolute

*Arminianism* emphasizes freedom:
- God's sovereignty is self-limited to preserve genuine human choice
- He foreknows what will happen but doesn't determine it
- Humans can resist God's grace
- Election is based on foreseen faith

*Molinism* attempts middle ground:
- God has "middle knowledge"—He knows what every possible person would freely choose in every possible circumstance
- He then creates the world where His purposes are accomplished through genuinely free human choices
- Sovereignty and freedom are both preserved

**The Tension:**
All three solutions assume we can systematize God's relationship with human will. But do they fit the biblical narrative?

Scripture doesn't give us a philosophical treatise on freedom and determinism. It tells stories: God hardens Pharaoh's heart, yet judges Pharaoh for his hardness. God ordains Christ's crucifixion, yet those who crucified Him are guilty. Joseph's brothers meant evil, but God meant it for good.

Perhaps the *paradox* is the revelation. Perhaps trying to resolve it through Greek logic imposes a framework Scripture doesn't share.

## Providence: God's Governance and the Reality of Evil

**The Biblical Data:**
- "The Lord works out everything to its proper end" (Proverbs 16:4)
- "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care" (Matthew 10:29)
- "How long, O Lord? Will You forget me forever?" (Psalm 13:1)
- "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1, quoted by Jesus on the cross)

**The Philosophical Problem:**
If God governs all things providentially, why does evil exist? Why do the innocent suffer?

**Classical Theodicies:**

*Free Will Defense*:
- God gave humans free will
- Moral evil results from human misuse of freedom
- God could eliminate evil only by eliminating freedom, which would eliminate the good of free love and obedience

*Soul-Making Theodicy*:
- Suffering builds character, faith, virtue
- A world without challenges wouldn't produce mature persons
- God permits suffering for the greater good of spiritual development

*Mystery Defense*:
- We can't see God's purposes from our limited perspective
- What seems evil to us may serve good we can't comprehend
- Trust God's wisdom even when we don't understand

**The Tension:**
All these approaches assume that if we think hard enough, we can explain why God permits evil. They treat the problem as *intellectual*—a puzzle to be solved through Greek reasoning.

But Scripture treats evil as *existential*—something to be lamented, fought, and ultimately defeated. The Psalms don't offer theodicies; they cry out to God in pain. Job receives no philosophical answer, only an encounter with God's overwhelming presence.

Perhaps the demand for systematic explanation is itself the Greek imposition. Perhaps Hebrew faith doesn't resolve the tension between God's goodness and the world's suffering—it *lives in* the tension, trusting God even in darkness.

## Incarnation: Eternal God in Time

**The Biblical Data:**
- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1)
- "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14)
- Christ is "the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15)
- He "emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant" (Philippians 2:7)

**The Philosophical Problem:**
If God is eternal, immutable, impassible—how can He become human, suffer, and die?

**The Classical Solution:**
The doctrine of the Hypostatic Union (Council of Chalcedon, 451 AD):
- Christ is one *person* with two *natures*
- Fully divine and fully human
- The natures are united without mixture, confusion, separation, or division
- The divine nature remains unchanging; the human nature experiences time, suffering, death

**The Strength:**
- Protects Christ's full deity (contra Arianism)
- Protects Christ's full humanity (contra Docetism)
- Uses Greek categories (nature, person) to articulate biblical truth

**The Tension:**
Does this preserve Greek philosophy at the expense of the Gospel? If the divine nature doesn't change or suffer, did *God* really become flesh? Or did a human nature get attached to an unchanging divine essence?

Scripture doesn't say "the human nature of Christ died." It says "*Christ* died" (Romans 5:8). The *person* suffered, not just one of His natures.

And if we insist that God's essence cannot suffer—are we protecting a Greek philosophical claim more than the biblical revelation that God loves vulnerably, grieves genuinely, and enters fully into our suffering?

## The Unresolved Question

All these doctrines—Trinity, Sovereignty, Providence, Incarnation—are attempts to reconcile the God of classical theism with the God of the Bible.

They achieve remarkable theological precision. They guard against heresies. They give the church a vocabulary for worship and confession.

But do they *succeed*? Or do they reveal that Greek categories and Hebrew revelation are fundamentally at odds?

Perhaps the tension is the point. Perhaps the God who is both eternal and temporal, unchanging and responsive, transcendent and incarnate—cannot be captured by any system, Greek or otherwise.

Perhaps we must choose: Will we start with philosophical reasoning about what God *must* be, and then fit Scripture into that framework? Or will we start with biblical revelation of who God *is*, and let it shatter our philosophical expectations?

The Living God may not fit our categories—even the orthodox ones.
