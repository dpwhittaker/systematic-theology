shortTitle: Reconciliation

[God](#god/god 'Parent')

Classical theism meets biblical revelation. Can they coexist?

The God of [essence](#god/essence 'Greek') and [attributes](#god/attributes 'Greek'): unchanging, impassible, eternal, simple.
The God of the Bible: grieves, relents, becomes flesh, suffers, dies.

Christian theology developed doctrines to reconcile these tensions:

**Core Reconciliations:**
- [Trinity](#god/trinity 'Drill'): One essence, three persons—unity with Father, Son, Spirit.
- [Incarnation](#god/incarnation 'Drill'): Eternal God in time—hypostatic union of divine and human natures.
- [Impassibility](#god/impassibility 'Drill'): Can God suffer, or is He unchangingly perfect?

**Providence and Freedom:**
- [Sovereignty](#god/sovereignty 'Drill'): Divine control and human freedom—Calvinism, Arminianism, Molinism.
- [Providence](#god/providence 'Drill'): God's governance and the reality of evil—theodicies and lament.

The question: Are these successful [syntheses](#intro/philosophy 'Greek'), or do they reveal an irresolvable conflict between Greek thought and Hebrew revelation?

Perhaps the tension is the point. Perhaps the Living God cannot be captured by any system—even the orthodox ones.
