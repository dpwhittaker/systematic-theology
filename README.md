# Systematic Theology: A Hebraic Re-examination

**Live Site:** [https://dpwhittaker.github.io/systematic-theology](https://dpwhittaker.github.io/systematic-theology)

## Project Overview
This project serves as a dual-purpose platform:
1.  **Research Notebook:** A living document of theological research, tracking hyperlinks from biblical verses to extrabiblical references and historical context.
2.  **Interactive Teaching HUD:** A static website designed to be viewed on smart glasses (Heads-Up Display) while teaching.

## Core Thesis
The central inquiry of this work is: **Is "Systematic Theology" fair to the God it seeks to characterize?** 

Traditional Systematic Theology often imposes a Hellenistic (Greek) framework—categorizing, defining, and abstracting—upon a God who revealed Himself through the Hebraic culture, which is concrete, relational, and narrative-driven. We will follow a standard multi-denominational course structure but constantly challenge the validity of the distinctions being made.

## Features
- **Drill-down Navigation:** Start with high-level concepts and drill down into verse-by-verse evidence.
- **HUD-Optimized UI:** Designed for zero-scroll, high-contrast readability on wearable displays.
- **Contextual Linking:** emphasis on connecting verses to their cultural and historical reality.
