Analyzed README.md and design.md. Created gemini.md with project overview and workflow instructions. Initialized prompts.md with the current user prompt.
Expanded design.md Section 2 to define the Lattice structure (Directed Acyclic Graph) and its ability to model connectivity over categorization. Updated Section 5 prototype to include "Threads" for lateral navigation.
Defined "Directional Semantics" in design.md: Up/Down for Abstraction/Detail and Left/Right for Hebraic/Hellenistic perspectives. Updated prototype layout to visualize this 4-way navigation.
Updated design.md Section 5 to a 3-column grid layout (Hebraic | Detail | Hellenistic). Refined interaction model: Up navigates immediately; Left/Right/Down cycle focus; Space selects.
