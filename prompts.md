analyze tbe readme.md and design.md, and create gemini.md to document useful information about the project for you to know on initial load.  one of the key points you should document is that every prompt I write should be stored in a prompts.md file, your outputs that are not a file should be logged to output.md, and every turn you complete that modifies any files should be committed and pushed. This way I can explore alternate threads of conversation in git branches. Include instructions to read prompts.md and outputs.md on each turn so that we can pick up where we left off after a checkout.

now that we have defined the rules of engagement, lets start working on design.md.  i like section 1, but section 2 needs more definition.  What is a lattice and how does it differ from a tree in this context?  How does it help us express these concepts better, and what UX elements become available in a lattice structure that werent available in a tree?  The prototype layout looks like a tree.  Explain how the lattice appears in the UI.

Ok, that is interesting.  So a tree only deals with parent-child relationships, but a lattice includes horizontal relationships.  I wonder if there is a useful left-right concept we could define, similar to up being parent and down being child?  I'm thinking Hebraic<->Hellenistic might be a cool way to define the horizontal direction for this project.
