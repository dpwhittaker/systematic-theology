analyze tbe readme.md and design.md, and create gemini.md to document useful information about the project for you to know on initial load.  one of the key points you should document is that every prompt I write should be stored in a prompts.md file, your outputs that are not a file should be logged to output.md, and every turn you complete that modifies any files should be committed and pushed. This way I can explore alternate threads of conversation in git branches. Include instructions to read prompts.md and outputs.md on each turn so that we can pick up where we left off after a checkout.
