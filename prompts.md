analyze tbe readme.md and design.md, and create gemini.md to document useful information about the project for you to know on initial load.  one of the key points you should document is that every prompt I write should be stored in a prompts.md file, your outputs that are not a file should be logged to output.md, and every turn you complete that modifies any files should be committed and pushed. This way I can explore alternate threads of conversation in git branches. Include instructions to read prompts.md and outputs.md on each turn so that we can pick up where we left off after a checkout.

now that we have defined the rules of engagement, lets start working on design.md.  i like section 1, but section 2 needs more definition.  What is a lattice and how does it differ from a tree in this context?  How does it help us express these concepts better, and what UX elements become available in a lattice structure that werent available in a tree?  The prototype layout looks like a tree.  Explain how the lattice appears in the UI.

Ok, that is interesting.  So a tree only deals with parent-child relationships, but a lattice includes horizontal relationships.  I wonder if there is a useful left-right concept we could define, similar to up being parent and down being child?  I'm thinking Hebraic<->Hellenistic might be a cool way to define the horizontal direction for this project.

ok, so the UX needs three columns: to the left, the most-related Hebrew concepts.  in the center, the drill-down details to go deeper on the current concept, and and to the right, the Hellenistic related concepts.  the header remains, with the parent topic and current topic.  pressing up immediately takes you to the parent.  pressing left, down, or right cycles through the concepts in that direction, and pressing space navigates you to that concept.
- the main panel still needs an area to describe the current context.  Between the header and navigation areas there should be a panel describing the current context.  Update the design.md
- Did you read gemini.md?  are you forgetting something?
- Better.  Does gemini.md need to be all caps for you to auto-load it?  Also, the context panel was not meant to be a just breadcrumbs and description.  The top title bar functions as breadcrumbs since it shows the Up hierarchical navigation.  if there is room we could add more of the hierarchy there to give more context.  The context panel was meant to be the main body of the card.  This is where we should define the concept, quote the verse, bullet point historical context, etc.  It should maintain glanceability by highlighting words that are most relevant to the topic, but give enough content to trigger talking points about the topic.  Child concepts should also be highlighted.
- Ok, let me give a better example... (redesign request details)

Follow the same operating procedure mentioned in gemini.md - track my prompts in prompts.md and your outputs (that aren't written to a file) in outputs.md.  commit and push on every turn where edits are made.  this will allow me and others to see how the site was built.  add these instructions to claude.md

Now lets make some minor modifications.  First, yes lets make the switch to Atkinson Hyperlegible.  Also, ensure the viewport is 16:9 aspect ratio.  When it is not, display the content in a 16:9 box.  Use the extra space for up/down/left/right/ok buttons for browser access.
