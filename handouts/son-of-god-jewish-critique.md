# Jesus: What Does It Mean to Be the Son of God?
## A Jewish Voice in a Christian Conversation

*The following is written from the perspective of a Jewish theologian who takes the Hebrew Scriptures seriously, respects Christian faith, and wants to help Christians understand why the doctrine of the Trinity — however well-intentioned — looks, from a Jewish vantage point, like three gods rather than one. This is not a polemic. It is an attempt at honest dialogue between people who share the same Scriptures and worship the same God of Abraham.*

## Part 1: What We Actually Agree On

Before I explain where I think Christianity went wrong, I want to name what I think both traditions must hold if either of us is to be coherent. These are not my concessions to Christianity. They are convictions I believe any serious reader of the Hebrew Scriptures is obligated to hold.

**Jesus was a real historical person.**
The debate about who Jesus was only matters if he actually existed. I have no quarrel here. The historical evidence — Jewish, Roman, and early Christian — is strong enough that serious historians do not dispute it. He was a first-century Jewish teacher from the Galilee, executed under Pontius Pilate, whose followers proclaimed him risen.

**Jesus was Jewish — entirely and specifically Jewish.**
He was not a generic spiritual teacher who happened to be born in Palestine. He was circumcised, Torah-observant, synagogue-attending, and thoroughly rooted in the tradition of Israel. He prayed to the God of Abraham. He read from the Hebrew Scriptures. He engaged in the kind of interpretive argument (*machloket*) that any rabbi would recognize. If you lose his Jewishness, you have lost him. A Gentile Jesus divorced from Israel is a fiction.

**The God Jesus worshipped is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.**
This is not negotiable, and Jesus himself made it explicit. When asked which commandment was the greatest, he answered by quoting the Shema — the very heart of Jewish prayer:

> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'" (**Mark 12:29-30**, NIV)

He did not say "worship me." He pointed to the God of Israel. Whatever else Christians believe about Jesus, they must begin here. He himself told you to begin here.

**Monotheism is non-negotiable.**
However Christianity ultimately explains the relationship between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the answer cannot be "three gods." If it is three gods, then Christianity has abandoned the faith of Abraham, Moses, and every prophet who ever spoke in the name of YHWH. I believe many Christians know this instinctively, which is why the doctrine of the Trinity has always insisted on oneness. My argument is not that Christians are secretly polytheists — most are not. My argument is that the *language* and *categories* they use often make it sound that way, and that the Hebrew Scriptures do not support the underlying metaphysical framework those categories assume.

**"Son of God" is a title, not a species.**
This is where the real disagreement begins. But I want to establish something first: both Jews and Christians should agree that the *phrase* "son of God" is not self-evidently a claim to divine ontology. The phrase appears throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and means something specific in that context. What it means has to be established *from the text*, not assumed from later doctrine.

## Part 2: What "Son of God" Actually Means in the Hebrew Scriptures

### The Phrase Has a Clear, Consistent Usage

In the world of the Hebrew Bible, "son of God" is a relational and functional title. It means someone who stands in a special, chosen, commissioned relationship with YHWH — who represents God to the world and carries out His purposes. It does not mean "a second member of a divine triad" or "God incarnate in human form."

Here is the evidence:

**Israel as a whole is called God's son:**

> "Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is My firstborn son, and I told you, "Let My son go, so he may worship Me."'" (**Exodus 4:22-23**, NIV)

> "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son." (**Hosea 11:1**, NIV)

Notice that Matthew cites this Hosea passage as a prophecy *fulfilled by Jesus* (Matthew 2:15) — which only makes sense if Jesus is understood as the embodiment, the recapitulation, of Israel's story. He is the true Israel. This is a Hebraic concept, not a Greek one. And it shows that "son of God" is a title for God's representative people, not a unique metaphysical claim.

**The Davidic king is called God's son:**

> "I will be his father, and he will be My son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands." (**2 Samuel 7:14**, NIV — God speaking of Solomon)

> "I will proclaim the LORD's decree: He said to me, 'You are My son; today I have become your father. Ask Me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.'" (**Psalm 2:7-8**, NIV)

This is the coronation Psalm. When Israel crowned a Davidic king, this language was used. "You are My son" was the declaration of divine adoption into a special covenantal role. The king was God's son in the sense that he was God's representative, his anointed (*Mashiach*) — the one through whom God would govern His people. It is an appointment, not a metaphysical claim about the king's inner nature.

**Angels are called "sons of God":**

> "One day the angels [*bene ha-Elohim*, sons of God] came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them." (**Job 1:6**, NIV)

> "...when the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?" (**Job 38:7** — the same Hebrew phrase, *bene Elohim*, translated as "sons of God")

> "The Nephilim were on the earth in those days — and also afterward — when the sons of God [*bene ha-Elohim*] went to the daughters of humans and had children by them." (**Genesis 6:1-4**, NIV)

Whatever one makes of this mysterious passage, it is clear that divine beings in the heavenly court were called "sons of God." The phrase describes relationship and status, not ontological identity with God Himself.

**Adam is called the son of God:**

> "...the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God." (**Luke 3:38**, NIV — in Luke's genealogy of Jesus)

Luke traces the lineage of Jesus all the way back to Adam, who is called "the son of God." Adam was the son of God in the sense that he was made directly by God, in God's image, to be God's representative on the earth. Again: a relational and functional title.

### What the Pattern Shows

Look at the consistent picture. The "son of God" is someone who:
- Is in a special, chosen relationship with YHWH
- Represents God to others (king, prophet, Israel as a whole)
- Has been commissioned to carry out God's purposes
- Stands in a position of honor and intimacy before the Creator

None of these usages suggests that the "son" *is* God, or that there are two (or three) divine beings sharing a single divine essence. The language is covenantal and relational. It describes a relationship, not an ontology.

### The Shema Constrains Every Interpretation

The most important verse in all of Jewish Scripture — the verse Jesus himself quoted when asked for the greatest commandment — is the Shema:

> "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." (**Deuteronomy 6:4**, NIV)

The Hebrew word translated "one" here is *echad* (אֶחָד). Some Christian teachers argue that *echad* implies a "compound unity" — the way one cluster of grapes is made of many grapes, or a married couple is called "one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). They use this to suggest the Shema itself hints at plurality within the Godhead.

But this argument does not hold up to scrutiny.

*Echad* is the ordinary Hebrew word for "one." It is used in the same verse — "one God" (*echad*). It is used in Deuteronomy 6:4 to make a singular, exclusive claim: *there is one, and He is not divided*. If Moses had meant to suggest plurality, there was a perfectly good Hebrew word for it — *yachid* (יָחִיד), which means "solitary, unique, alone." The Shema's claim is exactly what it sounds like: not many gods, and not one God who is secretly more than one. One. Full stop.

The Shema is not a riddle about divine mathematics. It is a declaration of absolute monotheism against the polytheism of Egypt and Canaan. It says: there is one God, He is *our* God, He is YHWH. Everything else — every other spirit, every other force, every other candidate for worship — is subordinate to or derivative from this one God. The Shema forecloses the idea of a second divine being who co-equally shares divinity.

### The God of Israel Speaks Unambiguously

The declarations of YHWH through the prophets are among the most absolute monotheistic statements in any ancient literature:

> "I am the first and I am the last; apart from Me there is no God." (**Isaiah 44:6**, NIV)

> "I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from Me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged Me, so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting people may know there is no one besides Me." (**Isaiah 45:5-6**, NIV)

> "You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides Him there is no other." (**Deuteronomy 4:35**, NIV)

> "Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other." (**Deuteronomy 4:39**, NIV)

> "See now that I myself am He! There is no god besides Me." (**Deuteronomy 32:39**, NIV)

> "I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning." (**Isaiah 46:9-10**, NIV)

These are not vague statements open to reinterpretation. They are precise, emphatic, and deliberately exclusive. The God speaking here does not say "there are no gods except the Father and Me." He says there are no others, period. He says He is the first and the last, that there is none like Him, that from east to west there is no one beside Him.

I want Christians to sit with these texts. Not dismiss them. Not read them through a doctrine that was formulated centuries later in Greek philosophical categories. Read them as Moses and Isaiah wrote them, as first-century Jewish listeners would have heard them. What they say is unmistakable.

## Part 3: Why the Trinity Looks Like Three Gods From Where We Stand

I want to be honest here, and I want to be fair.

I know that the doctrine of the Trinity has always insisted it is not three gods. The Nicene Creed says "one God." The Athanasian Creed says "we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance." I understand that.

But I ask you to listen to how it sounds from outside.

### The Language of Persons

The doctrine of the Trinity teaches three "persons" (*hypostases* in Greek) who share one divine "substance" (*ousia*). These persons are distinct — the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Spirit. Each has will, intellect, and relational identity. They speak to each other. They love each other. They commission each other.

From where I stand, three beings who have distinct will and identity, who relate to each other, who commission and send each other — those are three beings. The word "substance" connecting them does not do enough work to make them one. If I tell you about three people who share the same human nature, you would say I was describing three humans, not one.

### The Worship of Jesus

Christianity does not merely honor Jesus. It worships him. Not "worships the Father through him" or "worships God who was present in him." It worships Jesus himself as God — prays to him, sings to him, kneels before him.

But the God of Isaiah said: "I am the LORD; that is My name! I will not yield My glory to another or My praise to idols" (Isaiah 42:8). And again: "I am the LORD; that is My name; My glory I give to no one else" (Isaiah 42:8, slightly different rendering of the same warning).

The question for Christians is not whether Jesus deserves honor. The question is whether redirecting the worship that Scripture reserves exclusively for YHWH to a second being — however tightly linked to YHWH — violates the Shema.

### How Hellenistic Philosophy Transformed a Jewish Title

Here is what I believe happened historically, and I offer it not as an accusation but as an observation.

The early followers of Jesus were Jewish. They experienced something they could not fully explain — the resurrection, the outpouring of the Spirit, the presence of the risen Jesus in their midst. They applied to Jesus the highest titles they had: Lord (*Kyrios*), Son of God, Messiah. These were Jewish titles. They described a role and a relationship.

But as the early movement spread into the Greek-speaking world, these titles encountered a different set of questions. Greeks were not asking "What is his role?" or "What does his story mean for Israel?" They were asking "What is his *essence*?" and "What is his *nature*?" These are Platonic and Aristotelian questions. They come from a philosophical tradition that asks about eternal forms, substances, and the hierarchy of being.

The councils of the 4th century — Nicaea (325 AD), Constantinople (381 AD) — answered these Greek questions using Greek tools. *Homoousios* — "same substance." *Hypostasis* — "distinct personal subsistence." These are not Hebrew words. They are not words Moses or Isaiah or Jesus used. They are the vocabulary of Platonic philosophy.

I am not saying the councils were dishonest or malicious. They were trying, under real pressure from real heresies, to protect what they understood to be true about Jesus. But I am saying this: when you translate a Jewish title into a Greek metaphysical framework, you get a Greek metaphysical claim. And that Greek metaphysical claim — three persons sharing one substance — is not in the text of the Hebrew Scriptures. It is an interpretation of the text using philosophical categories that come from Athens, not Jerusalem.

## Part 4: What I Wish Christians Understood

### A Human Messiah Is Not a Lesser Messiah

The Jewish expectation of the Messiah was for a human king — anointed by God, empowered by God's Spirit, ruling with God's authority, bringing God's kingdom. This was the greatest possible office a human being could hold. It was not a consolation prize.

The kings of Israel were God's sons, His anointed ones, His representatives. The greatest king, David, was called "a man after God's own heart." To be the fulfillment of the Davidic covenant — to be the Messiah — was to be the highest human being in the history of Israel.

Christians sometimes assume that if Jesus is only human — even the greatest human, the most spirit-filled human, the resurrected human — then he is somehow less worthy of the significance they want to give him. But this assumption imports a Greek scale of value. In the Greek worldview, divine beings are necessarily greater than human ones. In the Hebrew worldview, the boundary between God and His creation is absolute — and humans can still be God's image-bearers, His sons, His representatives, His agents, without *being* God.

A Messiah who is God's uniquely beloved Son, anointed beyond all others, raised from the dead and vindicated before all creation, seated at God's right hand as His royal agent — this Messiah is staggering in his significance. He does not need to be the second member of a divine Trinity to be the most important figure in human history.

### The Difference Between God's Agent and God Himself

In Jewish theology, God acts through agents. Moses was God's agent — God spoke through him, acted through him, even said "I will send an angel before you" and then appeared in the pillar of cloud Himself (Exodus 33). The Patriarchs encountered "the angel of the LORD" in ways that seem almost identical to encountering God directly. In Jewish legal tradition, a properly authorized agent (*shaliach*) is equivalent to the one who sent him: "A person's agent is as the person himself" (Talmud, *Kiddushin* 41b).

If Jesus is God's uniquely authorized agent — His Son in the fullest possible sense of that Hebraic title — his words carry God's authority, his deeds enact God's will, his presence mediates God's relationship with humanity. That is a profound claim. That is a world-changing claim.

But it is different from saying Jesus *is* God. An agent is not the principal. The Son is not the Father. And the entire framework of the Hebrew Scriptures insists that the one who sends and the one who is sent are not the same being.

### The Paradox Should Stay Paradoxical

I admire the intellectual courage of those who formulated the doctrine of the Trinity. They were trying to hold together things Scripture says that pull in opposite directions:
- Jesus is one who can be prayed to and worshipped
- God is one and will not share His glory

They tried to resolve this tension with philosophical language. My argument is not that the tension should be dissolved in the opposite direction — by simply denying Jesus's significance. My argument is that perhaps the tension should not be dissolved at all.

The Pharisees held "everything is foreseen, yet freedom is given" without explaining how both could be true. The rabbis held "Torah is eternal, yet it was given in time" without resolving the paradox. The Hebraic tradition is not afraid of paradox. It is afraid of false precision.

Perhaps the right response to the mystery of Jesus is not to build a doctrine that explains it, but to sit with it — to say "God did something in Jesus that we do not fully understand, that both fits and strains the categories we have, and that we are still learning to read."

That humility is not weakness. It is the honest response to encountering the living God.

## Part 5: Common Ground — What We Can Commit to Together

Despite deep disagreement about the nature of Jesus, there is real common ground between Jews and Christians who take their Scriptures seriously. Here is what I believe we can honestly share:

**Commitment to the God of Israel.**
Not a generic deity. Not a philosophical first cause. The God who called Abraham out of Ur, who delivered Israel from Egypt, who spoke through the prophets, who demands justice and loves mercy. This is the God Jesus prayed to. It is the God I pray to. That matters more than the doctrinal disputes that divide us.

**Monotheism as a moral commitment, not just a theological one.**
Worshipping one God — and only one — means that no human power, no empire, no nation, no ideology can claim ultimate allegiance. The Shema is not just a statement about metaphysics. It is a refusal to give to Caesar, or to any human institution, what belongs to God alone. Jews and Christians share this resistance. It has cost both communities dearly throughout history.

**The obligations of covenant — justice, mercy, care for the poor.**
The prophets are unmistakable on this point. Whatever God's people believe about theology, they are judged by how they treat the widow, the orphan, the stranger, the poor. Isaiah, Amos, Micah, and Jesus himself all said essentially the same thing: right belief that does not issue in right action is not acceptable to God.

> "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." (**Micah 6:8**, NIV)

That verse is Jewish. Jesus lived it. You read it in your Bibles. Let us hold each other to it.

**Humility before mystery.**
No human being — Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or anything else — fully comprehends the God who spoke creation into existence and sustains it at every moment. Every theological tradition, including mine, has blind spots, errors, and places where human categories have been mistaken for divine revelation.

The appropriate response to the living God is not certainty but awe. Not a closed system but a posture of ongoing listening, arguing, questioning, and seeking. That is what the word "Israel" means — *one who wrestles with God*. I invite you to wrestle alongside us.

## A Final Word

I do not read the Hebrew Scriptures and conclude that Jesus was nothing, or that his followers were simply confused. Something happened that changed the world. Something in him pointed people, irresistibly, toward the God of Israel. He lived the Torah in a way that convicted people who met him. He died in a way that looked to his followers like Isaiah 53. And whatever happened after his death, his followers were willing to die for their testimony about it.

I take all of that seriously.

What I cannot follow Christians in is the move from "Jesus was uniquely filled with God's presence and authority" to "Jesus is the second member of a divine Trinity co-equal with the Father." That move required Greek philosophy to make. It is not native to the Hebrew Scriptures. And I believe it has made it harder, not easier, for the world to understand the God that both of our traditions are trying to worship.

The Shema is still true. "The LORD our God, the LORD is one." Whatever Jesus is — and I believe he was extraordinary — the God he prayed to is the God we both pray to. That unity is worth protecting, even at the cost of doctrinal comfort.
