# Jesus: What Does It Mean to Be the Son of God?
## The Modalist View (Sabellius, c. 215 AD)

*A collaborative handout for the study of Systematic Theology. This document presents the Modalist or Sabellian position — declared heretical by the early church but grounded in a passionate commitment to divine unity. Honest tensions are included. Sabellius speaks in first person.*

## A Word Before We Begin

I am Sabellius, and I want you to understand what drives me before you examine my arguments: I am a monotheist to the bone. The Shema burns in my soul — "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4). Everything I teach flows from that confession.

When I look at what later came to be called "the Trinity," I do not see a sophisticated synthesis of Scripture and philosophy. I see a subtle fracturing of divine unity — three centers of consciousness, three eternal "persons" who are somehow distinct and yet somehow one. I see Plato sneaking in through the back door while Scripture is being quoted at the front. I see the worship of one God quietly replaced by the worship of a committee.

And when I look at Arius — who says Jesus is a created being, exalted beyond all others but nonetheless a creature — I see something worse: paganism with a Jewish vocabulary. To worship a creature, however high, is idolatry. Arius's Jesus cannot save, because a creature cannot bridge the gulf between the Creator and creation.

My view: there is one God, one divine person, who has expressed Himself to humanity in three successive and real modes — as Father (Creator and Lawgiver), as Son (Redeemer and Incarnate), and as Holy Spirit (Sanctifier and Indweller). These are not three beings. They are not three persons in the modern sense. They are one God — fully, really, and completely — meeting humanity in three redemptive roles.

## Section 1: Guardrails — What I Insist On

These are the outer limits I hold absolutely. Cross these lines and you have left Christianity, not merely shifted your theology.

**1. There is exactly one God — not one-in-three, not three-in-one, but ONE.**
The arithmetic of God is not complicated. It is one. "I am the LORD your God... you shall have no other gods before Me" (Exodus 20:2-3). Not one God organized into three persons — one God, period. The Shema is not a hint at hidden plurality; it is an assertion of absolute singularity. Any framework that introduces irreducible distinctions into the divine being has already begun dividing what cannot be divided.

*Outside this line:* Tritheism in any form — whether the crude paganism of many gods, or the sophisticated academic version that speaks of three co-eternal, co-equal "persons" sharing a single substance. If there are three genuine centers of consciousness, three genuine wills, three genuine "I"s — that is three gods, regardless of what terminology is deployed. The Nicene framework, for all its elegant language, cannot escape this gravity.

**2. Jesus IS God — not a representative of God, not a creature of God, not a lesser deity, but God Himself in human flesh.**
This is where I part ways with Arius absolutely. When you look at Jesus of Nazareth, you are looking at the Creator of the universe. All the fullness of Godhead dwells in Him (Colossians 2:9). Not a portion. Not a third. All of it. He is "God manifested in the flesh" (1 Timothy 3:16) — the one divine person, the Almighty, stepping into human experience to redeem it from the inside.

*Outside this line:* Any position that makes Jesus less than fully, completely, absolutely God. Arianism. Jehovah's Witnesses. Any "high Christology" that still leaves a gap between Jesus and the Father. If Jesus is not God Himself — not a representative, not an ambassador, but the actual divine person — then worshipping Him is idolatry. I will not worship a creature. I worship God, and Jesus is God.

**3. Jesus is the Messiah — the fulfillment of every promise made to Israel.**
He is the seed of Abraham, the Son of David, the Prophet like Moses, the Suffering Servant of Isaiah, the coming King of Zechariah. He cannot be understood apart from the Hebrew Scriptures. The story of Israel is the story God was telling to get to the moment He would put on human flesh and walk among us.

*Outside this line:* Any Christianity that has shed its Jewish roots — that reads the Old Testament as merely background information for the real story. Marcionism, which wanted to discard the Hebrew Scriptures entirely, produced a different God and therefore a different Jesus.

**4. Jesus bodily rose from the dead.**
This is not poetry. This is not the disciples' renewed courage or the memory of a good teacher living on. The tomb was physically empty. The same body that was crucified was raised, glorified, and ascended. "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile" (1 Corinthians 15:17, NIV). Everything depends on this.

*Outside this line:* Any resurrection theology that reduces Easter to a spiritual metaphor, a transformation of consciousness, or a subjective experience of the disciples. The body matters. Creation matters. God does not abandon matter — He redeems it.

**5. Salvation comes through Jesus alone.**
Not through good intentions. Not through sincerity in any religion. Through Jesus — the specific, historical, bodily person who died and rose. "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6, NIV). There is no alternate route.

*Outside this line:* Religious pluralism in any form. The universal fatherhood of God as a path to the universal brotherhood of man, with Jesus as one option among equally valid others, is not Christianity.

**6. Jesus was sinless — perfectly, completely, in every moment of His life.**
This is not a technicality. The entire logic of His death depends on it. He bore our sin without being a sinner who needed someone to bear His. He was the perfect Passover lamb — unblemished.

## Section 2: My View — What Does "Son of God" Mean?

### The Central Claim

When I read Scripture, I see one God who reveals Himself in three successive modes or manifestations. "Father," "Son," and "Holy Spirit" are not labels for three distinct eternal persons — they are names for the three ways the one God has turned His face toward humanity.

Think of it this way: the sun pours out light, and light produces warmth. Light and warmth are genuinely distinct expressions of the same source — yet you do not have three suns. You have one reality expressing itself in different modes. (Every analogy limps, but the point stands: unity can express itself in genuinely distinct ways without becoming plurality of being.)

"Son of God" means God Himself — the one divine person — entering human existence as a human being. Not a second person dispatched by a first person. Not a divine emissary sent from a heavenly committee. God Himself, taking on flesh, for our redemption.

### The Biblical Evidence

**Isaiah 9:6 — The Child IS the Everlasting Father**

> *For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.* (NKJV)

Read this carefully. The one who is called "Son" is also called "Everlasting Father." The same individual. How can the Son be the Father? Because they are not two distinct eternal persons — they are one person, referred to differently by role. This is not a difficult text for me. It is my proof text. The one born as Son *is* the Everlasting Father. Isaiah knew of no eternal distinction between two divine persons; he knew of one God who would come as a child.

**John 10:30 — Not "United" But ONE**

> *"I and My Father are one."* (NKJV)

The Trinitarians want this to mean "one in purpose, one in will, one in action" — not one in person. They note that the Greek is *hen*, a neuter form, to argue He is not claiming personal identity with the Father. But I ask: why does Jesus say this at all? Because the Jews are accusing Him of claiming to be God (John 10:33). If all He meant was "my Father and I have the same agenda," the Jews would not have picked up stones. They picked up stones because they understood exactly what He was saying: I am the one God of Israel. He and the Father are not two persons who happen to agree — He is the one divine person.

**John 14:9 — Not "A Representation" But THE FATHER**

> *"He who has seen Me has seen the Father."* (NKJV)

Philip asks to see the Father. Jesus does not say: "Philip, the Father is a different person whom you would recognize as sharing my nature." He says: you have *seen the Father*. Past tense. Already. In Me. If I look at you and you show me a photograph of your identical twin, I have not seen you. But when you show me a mirror, I have seen you. Jesus is the mirror of God — not because He reflects another person, but because He *is* that person.

**Colossians 2:9 — ALL the Fullness**

> *For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.* (NKJV)

*All* the fullness. Not one-third. Not a portion allocated to the second member. All of what God is, in bodily form, in Jesus. If there are three co-equal divine persons, how does all of God's fullness dwell in only one of them? The answer that emerges from my view is simple: because Jesus is the one God, there is no fullness of God that is anywhere else.

**1 Timothy 3:16 — God Manifested in Flesh**

> *And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory.* (NKJV)

Not "the second person of the triune God was manifested in the flesh." *God* was manifested in the flesh. The subject is God. One God. One manifestation. One incarnation. The mystery Paul is marveling at is not the metaphysics of three-in-one — it is the incomprehensible condescension of the one divine person entering human existence. *That* is the mystery of godliness.

**Isaiah 44:6 and Revelation 1:17-18 — The First and the Last Is Jesus**

> *"I am the First and I am the Last; besides Me there is no God."* (Isaiah 44:6, NKJV)

> *"Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."* (Revelation 1:17-18, NKJV)

The one speaking in Isaiah — the LORD God of Israel, who insists there is no God besides Him — applies the identical title to Jesus in Revelation. Same title. Same speaker. One God. If the Father is the First and the Last, and Jesus is the First and the Last, there are not two Firsts and two Lasts. There is one God who speaks in both places.

**John 8:58 — Jesus Claims the Name of Moses's Burning Bush**

> *"Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM."* (NKJV)

When God spoke to Moses from the burning bush and Moses asked His name, God said: "I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3:14). *Ego eimi* in Greek. The same words Jesus uses here. He is not merely claiming to pre-exist Abraham. He is claiming to be the same divine person who appeared to Moses. Not a "second person" who also existed before Abraham — the very I AM of the Exodus. One God. One name. One person.

### The "Roles, Not Persons" Framework

My critics say I misunderstand Scripture's language about the Father and Son. I say they misunderstand human language about roles and persons.

Consider: a single human being can be simultaneously a father, a son, a husband, and an employer. He is one person playing multiple roles — roles that are genuinely distinct in their relationships and functions, but which do not divide him into multiple persons. When he is at work, he does not stop being a father. When he is at home, he does not stop being an employee. One person, multiple genuine modes of relating.

Now apply this to God. As Creator and Lawgiver, He relates to us as Father. As Incarnate Redeemer, He relates to us as Son. As Sanctifier and Indweller, He relates to us as Spirit. These are not three gods. They are not three persons. They are one God — one divine person — who has expressed Himself in three genuine and distinct redemptive relationships with humanity.

**On the "Sending" Language**

My critics ask: if the Father and Son are the same person, how can the Father "send" the Son? This is a fair question. My answer: the sending language describes God's redemptive initiative. God, in His eternal purpose, appointed a moment in history when He would enter human existence as the Redeemer. The "sending" is not one person dispatching another — it is God's own decision to step into creation in redemptive mode. A human director does not dispatch a second person when he decides to walk onto his own stage. He simply does it. God walked onto His own stage in the person of Jesus.

**On the Baptismal Formula**

"Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19, NIV). Note carefully: *name* — singular, not *names* plural. There is one name. The three titles describe the one name of the one God who saves, redeems, and sanctifies. This is not evidence of three persons — it is evidence of one God who has three modes of relationship with humanity, all united under a single name.

### My Case Against Trinitarianism

**"Person" is a philosophical import, not a biblical category.**
The Trinitarians speak of three *hypostases* — three distinct subsistences or centers of being in God. But where does Scripture use this language? It does not. The language of three persons was developed at Nicaea and Chalcedon using Greek philosophical concepts that the Hebrew prophets had never heard of. They were solving a Greek philosophical problem — how to hold together the biblical data using categories drawn from Plato and Aristotle — rather than letting the Hebrew-shaped testimony of Scripture speak for itself.

When Isaiah says "besides Me there is no God," he does not mean "besides Me and my two co-equal eternal companions there are no other gods." He means what he says: one God, no others, no exceptions.

**If three persons share one substance, you have either three gods or an abstraction.**
Either the Father, Son, and Spirit are three genuinely distinct centers of consciousness and will — in which case you have three gods, however insistently you deny it — or the "one substance" they share is a philosophical abstraction, not a genuine divine person. In that case, who is God? Not the Father alone, not the Son alone, not the Spirit alone — but some impersonal substrate that none of them are. This is not the God of Abraham, who said "I AM."

**The Shema does not mean "one-in-three."**
*Echad* — the Hebrew word for "one" in the Shema — can describe a compound unity (like "one cluster of grapes," Numbers 13:23). Trinitarians sometimes use this to argue the Shema is already hinting at plurality-in-unity. But *echad* is the ordinary Hebrew word for "one." It describes one year, one man, one day. The effort to find Trinity in the Shema is a desperate interpretive maneuver driven by a predetermined conclusion.

## Section 3: Honest Tensions

I insist on honesty. There are genuine difficulties in my view, and I will name them rather than evade them.

**1. If the Father and Son are the same person, who is Jesus praying to?**

The prayer in Gethsemane — "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will" (Matthew 26:39, NIV) — sounds like a dialogue between two genuine persons. A person does not pray to himself.

My response: the Incarnation involves a genuine distinction between the divine will and the human will. In Jesus, the eternal God took on a human nature — including a genuinely human will, human emotions, human anguish. The prayer in Gethsemane is the human nature of the incarnate God expressing itself to the divine will. It is not two persons in dialogue — it is one person in whom two natures are genuinely present, the human crying out to the divine within the same incarnate being.

I acknowledge this is not a perfectly comfortable answer. The language of prayer implies relationality that strains a strictly single-person model. I hold to it because the alternative — two persons — seems to me a greater problem than the strain.

**2. "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" — Did God forsake Himself?**

This is the Patripassianism objection: on my view, the Father suffered on the cross, which seems absurd. If God died, who raised Him from the dead?

My response: the forsakenness is the experience of the human nature, separated in that moment from the fullness of divine presence — not God ceasing to exist, but the incarnate God experiencing in His human nature the full weight of divine abandonment that sin produces. The divine nature did not cease. God did not die in the sense of divine nature terminating. But the incarnate God, in His human nature, experienced death genuinely — including the experience of God-forsakenness that all sinners deserve.

Who raised Jesus? God raised Jesus — the one divine will re-animating the incarnate human nature it had assumed. This is not incoherent, but I confess it requires careful handling.

**3. The Baptism — Three Simultaneous Manifestations**

At the baptism of Jesus, the Spirit descends like a dove, the Father speaks from heaven, and the Son stands in the water. Three apparently simultaneous, apparently distinct manifestations. This is perhaps the hardest text for my position.

My response: the one God is simultaneously present in multiple modes. The Father's voice from heaven is God declaring His purpose. The Spirit is God's presence and power descending upon the human nature of the incarnate Son. The Son in the water is God incarnate. One God, three simultaneous expressions of His activity. A human king can simultaneously sign a decree (kingly role), speak to his children (fatherly role), and think a private thought (personal inner life) — without becoming three persons.

I will not pretend this explanation resolves all the difficulty. The simultaneity is genuinely challenging for my framework.

**4. "No One Knows the Day or the Hour, Not Even the Son"**

"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father" (Mark 13:32, NIV). If the Son and Father are the same person, how does one know something the other doesn't?

My response: the Son, as the Incarnate mode of God, accepted genuine limitations of human knowledge. The human nature of Jesus did not access all divine knowledge during the Incarnation — this is Paul's point in Philippians 2:7, the *kenosis* (emptying). The Father "knows" in the divine mode; the Son "does not know" in the incarnate, humanly-limited mode. Same person, different modes of knowing appropriate to the mode of existence.

Again, this requires positing within the one person a genuine distinction between divine and human knowing — which some will argue is tantamount to what my opponents call "two natures," and they will have a point.

**5. Romans 8:34 — Jesus at the Right Hand of God**

"Christ Jesus who died — more than that, who was raised to life — is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us" (NIV). Is Jesus sitting next to Himself?

My response: "the right hand of God" is a positional metaphor for divine authority and honor, not a spatial description of two persons occupying adjacent chairs. Jesus, exalted and glorified, is described in terms that locate Him within the sphere of divine authority — not beside a separate divine person, but *as* the one divine person exercising the fullness of redemptive authority.

## Section 4: Common Ground — What All Views Must Affirm

Whatever one concludes about the inner life of God, these commitments are not optional for anyone who calls themselves a Christian.

**Jesus is the definitive and final revelation of who God is.**
Not a hint. Not a partial disclosure. Not one chapter in a story that continues with Muhammad or Joseph Smith or any other. In Jesus, the one God of Israel has said everything there is to say about Himself. His character — His astonishing mercy, His bone-deep justice, His tenderness toward the broken, His fury at religious hypocrisy, His willingness to die for enemies — is not the personality of one divine person among three. It is the character of God. To know Jesus is to know God.

**The resurrection is God's verdict on everything.**
He died and He rose. The tomb is empty. Whatever you believe about the metaphysics of the divine nature, you must believe this. Christianity is not a philosophy or an ethical system. It is a report: the one who was dead is alive. And because He lives, death is not the last word for anyone who is united to Him.

**The cross is the center of everything.**
God did not arrange for a third party to suffer in our place. God bore it Himself — in the flesh He assumed, through the death He died. Whoever you think was on the cross, Christian faith requires you to believe that death accomplished something — that it was not merely a tragic martyrdom but the event through which sin was dealt with and the broken relationship between God and humanity was repaired.

**Worship, obedience, and love are the only adequate responses.**
Doctrinal precision matters — I would not be arguing as passionately as I am if I thought it didn't. But the goal of theology is doxology. We think carefully about God in order to love Him more truly and follow Him more faithfully. The person who is uncertain about the finer points of Christological formulation but who pours out their life in love for God and neighbor has understood something essential. The person who has the doctrine precise but whose heart is cold has understood very little.

**Prayer is real.**
Whether the Son is a distinct person who intercedes at the Father's right hand, or whether the risen Christ is the one God in redemptive mode continuing to mediate between the divine and human — prayer is genuine communication with the living God, and He hears it. Do not let the theological debates crowd out your actual practice of speaking to Him.

**The poor, the outcast, and the suffering are where Jesus is found.**
This is consistent across every Christological tradition, because it is what Jesus actually said and did. The one who is God in flesh chose the company of lepers and prostitutes and Roman collaborators and the demon-possessed. Any theology of Jesus that does not produce a community with that same orientation has gone wrong somewhere, regardless of its credal precision.

**Christological debate should be pursued with humility.**
I hold my position with conviction. I believe the Trinitarian framework introduces a fatal error into Christian monotheism. But I also know that the people who disagree with me — including those who eventually declared my view heretical — were wrestling with the same Scriptures I wrestled with, driven by the same desire to be faithful to revelation. They were not fools or frauds. They were men trying to hold together truths that resist easy systematization. I disagree with their conclusion, but I honor the seriousness with which they engaged the question.

The same charity is owed in both directions.
