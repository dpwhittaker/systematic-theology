# God and Time: Does the Future Exist?

A study of God's relationship with time, examining how different traditions understand divine knowledge, the reality of the future, and what it means when Scripture says God "changed His mind."

## Guardrails: The Outer Limits of Christian Belief About God

Before exploring the *internal* debates among Christians about God and time, it helps to mark the outer boundaries — positions that place a person *outside* Christian orthodoxy altogether. These are not lines drawn over minor disputes. Crossing them means affirming something the church has consistently identified as a different religion.

**1. There is only one God.**
The God of Scripture is not one deity among many equals. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three separate gods. And the gods of other religions are not gods in the same sense: Baal, Aphrodite, Zeus, and Allah are not alternate names for the same divine reality.

*Outside this line:* Polytheism (Greek, Roman, Norse, Canaanite religions). Mormonism teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three separate divine beings, and that there are potentially countless gods across the universe — making it formally polytheistic despite using Christian language.

**2. This God is specifically the God of Israel — the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.**
The God of the Bible is not a generic divine being who goes by different names in different cultures. He revealed Himself to a specific people, through specific events, in a specific story. Allah, Brahman, the Great Spirit, and the God of Scripture may share some attributes in common, but that does not make them the same God. Christianity is not one path up a universal mountain.

*Outside this line:* Religious pluralism (all religions worship the same God under different names). Islam affirms monotheism and honors Abraham, but explicitly denies the incarnation and the authority of the New Testament — a different God-story, not simply a different denomination. Bahá'í Faith teaches that all major prophets — Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, others — revealed the same God progressively, making the Bible's specific claims relative rather than definitive.

**3. God is personal — not an impersonal force or the universe itself.**
God speaks, loves, grieves, and relates to persons. He is not "the ground of being," a cosmic energy field, or the sum total of existence. "God is love" does not mean love is God; it means a personal Being defines what love is.

*Outside this line:* Pantheism (God = the universe; found in Spinoza, some forms of Hinduism, and much New Age spirituality). Deism (God set the universe in motion but is now remote and uninvolved — more a first cause than a Father who hears prayer).

**4. God is uncreated — He did not come into existence.**
God has always existed. He was not made, born, or derived from a higher source. Everything else that exists was created; He was not. He cannot have a creator, because that creator would then be God.

*Outside this line:* Mormonism teaches that God the Father was once a mortal man who progressed to divinity ("As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become"). Gnosticism posited a "demiurge" — a lesser, flawed divine being derived from a higher realm — as the creator of the material world, making God himself a derived and imperfect entity.

**5. God is wholly good — He is not the author of evil or one half of a cosmic duality.**
God does not have a dark side. Evil is not His equal and opposite. He is not neutral between good and evil, nor the source of both. The existence of evil is a theological problem *for* Christian theism, not a feature of it.

*Outside this line:* Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism teach cosmic dualism — a good god and an evil god in eternal, roughly equal conflict. Some Gnostic systems teach that the creator of the material world was malevolent or incompetent, and that the true, higher God is remote from creation. Satanism treats evil as a divine or transcendent principle.

## I. How Do We Know God?

Two approaches shape this entire discussion:

**The Greek Approach — Define God's Essence:**
Start with abstract attributes: omniscient, omnipotent, immutable, eternal. These are timeless truths about what God *is*. From these definitions, deduce what God can and cannot do. If He is immutable, He cannot change. If He is omniscient, He cannot learn. The attributes come first; the stories illustrate them.

**The Hebrew Approach — Watch What God Does:**
Start with God's actions in history: He created, He called Abraham, He delivered Israel, He sent His Son. His character is revealed through His deeds, not defined by philosophical categories. "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2) — His identity *is* His action.

> The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished. (**Exodus 34:6-7**, NIV)

This is God's self-description — not a list of abstract attributes, but a declaration of how He relates to people. Notice: every quality is relational. Compassionate *toward* someone. Gracious *to* someone. Forgiving *someone's* sin.

The question of God's relationship with time is where these two approaches diverge most sharply.

## II. The Attributes That Frame the Debate

Three classical attributes of God are directly at stake:

**Omniscience** — God knows all things.
- Does "all things" include the future?
- If so, does He know it because He *sees* it, or because He *determined* it?
- Can you "know" something that doesn't exist yet?

> Great is our Lord and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit. (**Psalm 147:5**, NIV)

> Before a word is on my tongue You, LORD, know it completely. (**Psalm 139:4**, NIV)

**Immutability** — God does not change.
- Does this mean His *character* doesn't change, or His *plans* don't change?
- If God responds to prayer, has He changed?
- If God "relents," was the original plan real?

> I the LORD do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed. (**Malachi 3:6**, NIV)

> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. (**Hebrews 13:8**, NIV)

**Eternality** — God exists beyond time.
- Does "eternal" mean *timeless* (outside of time entirely) or *everlasting* (existing through all time)?
- Did God create time itself, or does He move through it?

> Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God. (**Psalm 90:2**, NIV)

> With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. (**2 Peter 3:8**, NIV)

---

## III. When God Changed His Mind

The Hebrew word *nacham* (נחם) comes from the idea of "breathing deeply" — a physical expression of deep feeling. It can mean to comfort, to grieve, to relent, to be sorry, or to change one's mind. Scripture uses it of God repeatedly.

### God Regretted Making Humanity

> The LORD regretted [*nacham*] that He had made human beings on the earth, and His heart was deeply troubled. (**Genesis 6:6**, NIV)

### God Relented After Moses Interceded

> Then the LORD relented [*nacham*] and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened. (**Exodus 32:14**, NIV)

*Context:* Israel made the golden calf. God told Moses He would destroy Israel and start over with Moses. Moses argued back — reminding God of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And God relented.

### God Regretted Making Saul King — But God Does Not Change His Mind

> I regret [*nacham*] that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me. (**1 Samuel 15:11**, ESV)

Then, eighteen verses later in the same chapter:

> The Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret [*nacham*], for he is not a man, that he should have regret [*nacham*]. (**1 Samuel 15:29**, ESV)

The same word. The same chapter. God *does* relent (v. 11). God does *not* relent (v. 29). Both statements are presented as true.

### God Relented Regarding Nineveh

> When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, He relented [*nacham*] and did not bring on them the destruction He had threatened. (**Jonah 3:10**, NIV)

### The Principle: God's Declarations Are Conditional

> If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, and if it does evil in My sight and does not obey Me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. (**Jeremiah 18:7-10**, NIV)

This may be the key to the *nacham* passages. God's dealings with people are *relational* — responsive to what they do. His character doesn't change, but His actions respond to the relationship.

### Additional Passages

> Return to the LORD your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and He relents [*nacham*] from sending calamity. Who knows? He may turn and relent. (**Joel 2:13-14**, NIV)

> The LORD relented [*nacham*] concerning this. "It will not happen," the LORD said. (**Amos 7:3**, NIV — in response to Amos's intercession)

> He remembered for their sake his covenant, and relented [*nacham*] according to the abundance of his steadfast love. (**Psalm 106:45**, ESV)

## IV. When God Declared the End from the Beginning

If Section III presents the strongest biblical case for divine responsiveness, these passages form the core of the classical argument — that God does not merely *react* to history but *declares* it in advance with specific, testable precision.

### Cyrus Named Before His Birth

> Who says of Cyrus, "He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose"; saying of Jerusalem, "She shall be built," and of the temple, "Your foundation shall be laid." (**Isaiah 44:28**, ESV)

> Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him... (**Isaiah 45:1**, ESV)

Isaiah wrote in the 8th century BC. Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon and issued his decree releasing the Jewish exiles in 539 BC — approximately 150 years later. The text names him by name, describes his specific role in releasing the captives, and specifies the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple. This is not a general prediction of restoration; it is a named, historically verifiable fulfillment of a specific prophecy.

### All Our Days Written Before We Were Born

> For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb... Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there were none of them. (**Psalm 139:13, 16**, ESV)

The psalmist does not say God *watched* his life unfold — he says God *wrote* it before it began. Each day was "fashioned" and recorded before any of them existed.

### The Cross Planned Before Creation

> This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. (**Acts 2:23**, ESV)

> For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. (**Acts 4:27-28**, ESV)

The crucifixion — including the specific human actors (Herod, Pilate, the crowds) — fulfilled what God's purpose "determined before to be done." The betrayal of an innocent man by free human agents was not a tragedy God incorporated into His plan after the fact. It *was* His plan, determined in advance.

> ...knowing that you were ransomed... not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was foreknown *before the foundation of the world* but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you. (**1 Peter 1:18-20**, ESV)

### God's People Chosen Before the Foundation of the World

> ...even as he chose us in him *before the foundation of the world*, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will. (**Ephesians 1:4-5**, ESV)

Paul does not say God foresaw who *would* believe and chose accordingly. He says God *chose us in Him* before the world existed — prior to any human decision.

### God's Purpose Cannot Be Thwarted

> Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will happen... For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? (**Isaiah 14:24, 27**, NIV)

> I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted. (**Job 42:2**, NIV)

> Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails. (**Proverbs 19:21**, NIV)

The consistent testimony is not that God responds skillfully to unfolding events, but that His purposes *cannot fail*. Not "probably won't" — cannot.

### The Takeaway

These passages are not easily dismissed as anthropomorphism. A named individual born 150 years after the prophecy, fulfilling it precisely — this is either genuine foreknowledge or the text is not historical. The cross planned before creation suggests the future is not merely *probable* for God but *settled*. The question is not whether God knows the future, but how — and what that means for human freedom and divine relationship.

## V. Three Views on God and Time

### View 1: The Classical/Calvinist View — God Outside of Time

**Core Claim:** God exists entirely outside of time. He does not experience past, present, or future as a sequence. All of history is simultaneously present to Him.

**The Metaphor:** Aquinas compared it to a mountain summit. A traveler on a road can only see the stretch ahead of them. Someone on the summit sees the entire road at once. God is on the summit; we are on the road.

**The Definition:** Boethius defined eternity as "the whole, simultaneous and perfect possession of boundless life" — not just living forever, but existing outside of time altogether.

**Key Arguments:**
- God *created* time. The Creator cannot be subject to what He creates (Augustine, *Confessions* Book XI: "There was no 'before' creation because time did not exist yet").
- A perfect being cannot change. Experiencing different moments would be change. Therefore God must be timeless (from divine simplicity and immutability).
- If God is in time, His knowledge changes as new moments arrive. But perfect knowledge cannot increase or decrease.
- God's knowledge is not "fore"-knowledge — He simply *knows*, because all moments are present to Him.

**On "God Changed His Mind":** These are *anthropopathisms* — human emotional language accommodating our finite minds. When Scripture says "God relented," it means God's predetermined plan *appeared* to change from our perspective. From eternity, He always knew the outcome. Calvin wrote: "God is accommodating Himself to us."

**Key Scriptures:**
> I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done. (**Isaiah 46:9-10**, ESV)

> Before Abraham was, I am. (**John 8:58**, ESV — not "I was," but "I am" — the divine name)

> God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should change His mind. (**Numbers 23:19**, NIV)

**Key Proponents:** Augustine, Boethius, Aquinas, Calvin

**Strength:** God's sovereignty is absolute. His plans cannot be thwarted. His promises are utterly certain. Nothing surprises Him.

**Tension:** If God sees all of time at once, does prayer actually change anything? If the future is already "there" for God to see, is it genuinely open? And if every use of emotional language about God is just accommodation, what does the Bible actually tell us about who He is?

---

### View 2: The Arminian View — God Knows but Doesn't Determine

**Core Claim:** God has exhaustive foreknowledge — He knows everything that will happen, including every future free choice. But His knowing does not *cause* what happens. He foresees; He does not predetermine.

**What Arminius Actually Taught:**
Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) affirmed that God knows the future exhaustively. The difference from Calvin is *how* God knows it and *what role* that knowledge plays in His decisions:
- **Calvin:** God's eternal decree *determines* all events. Foreknowledge and foreordination are two sides of the same coin.
- **Arminius:** God's foreknowledge is logically prior to His decree. God first knows what free creatures will do, and *then* decrees accordingly. The future is real and known to God, but not *determined by* God's knowledge of it.

Arminius wrote: "Though the understanding of God be certain and infallible, that does not impose any necessity on things; nay, rather it establishes in them a contingency."

**Arminius's Four Decrees (in logical order):**
1. God appointed Christ as Savior
2. God decreed to save believers and condemn the unbelieving
3. God decreed to provide the means of salvation (grace, the gospel, the Spirit)
4. God decreed to save and condemn *particular individuals* — based on His foreknowledge of who would freely believe

**On "God Changed His Mind":** God's threats and promises are genuinely conditional (the Jeremiah 18 principle). God foreknows the outcome, but the conditionality is real, not theatrical. God's *character* never changes (Malachi 3:6), but His *actions* genuinely respond to human choices that He foreknew.

**On Time:** Most classical Arminians affirm divine timelessness, like Calvinists. But some scholars note a tension: if God is truly timeless and sees everything at once, it becomes hard to maintain that He genuinely *responds* to creatures — and responsiveness is essential to Arminian theology. This tension has led some later Arminians toward "divine temporalism" — God is *everlasting* (has always existed and always will) rather than *timeless* (outside time altogether).

**Strength:** Preserves both God's knowledge and human responsibility. Evangelism and prayer genuinely matter — people can respond or refuse. God is not the author of evil.

**Tension:** If God foreknows every choice infallibly, can those choices be truly free? If God knew before creation that billions would reject Him and suffer eternally, why create at all? And if God's plans depend on human choices, can He guarantee outcomes like Christ's return and final victory?

### View 3: The Second Temple Jewish View — "Everything Is Foreseen, Yet Freedom Is Given"

Jewish theology in the centuries surrounding Jesus was not monolithic. Three major movements held strikingly different positions — positions that map remarkably well onto later Christian debates.

**The Pharisees — The Middle Path:**
Josephus records: "The Pharisees ascribe all to fate [providence] and to God, and yet allow that to act what is right, or the contrary, is principally in the power of men, although fate does cooperate in every action."

This is crystallized in Rabbi Akiva's famous paradox (Pirkei Avot 3:15):

> Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given; the world is judged with goodness, and everything is according to the preponderance of works.

Akiva does not explain *how* both are true simultaneously. The tension is acknowledged, not resolved. This is characteristically Hebraic — holding paradox rather than resolving it through Greek logic.

The Pharisees also believed in resurrection, the immortality of the soul, and rewards and punishments after death. Most New Testament authors came from Pharisaic or Pharisee-adjacent backgrounds.

**The Essenes — Full Divine Determinism:**
Josephus: "The Essenes ascribe all things to God." The Dead Sea Scrolls, associated with this movement, present the most explicitly deterministic theology in Second Temple Judaism:
- History is a predestined struggle between the Spirit of Light and the Spirit of Darkness (1QS 3:13-4:26)
- Every person is assigned to one of two "lots" — sons of light or sons of darkness — before birth
- Yet people are still blamed for their transgressions

This paradox — holding people accountable for what was predetermined — parallels Calvinist theology strikingly.

The apocalyptic literature shares this outlook. 1 Enoch presents the entire course of history as predetermined, laid out in advance in "weeks." The Book of Jubilees speaks of "heavenly tablets" containing a "Book of Destiny" — the future *written* before it happens.

**The Sadducees — Human Autonomy:**
Josephus: "The Sadducees take away fate entirely, and suppose that God is not concerned in our doing or not doing what is evil. To act what is good, or what is evil, is at men's own choice." They denied resurrection and afterlife rewards.

**Philo of Alexandria — The Greek Synthesis:**
Philo (~20 BC - 50 AD) represents Hellenized Judaism — the very synthesis this discussion is examining. He interpreted Moses through Plato, presenting God as absolutely transcendent, timeless, beyond change. The Logos (Divine Word/Mind) mediates between God and creation. Philo shows that the fusion of Greek categories with Hebrew thought was already happening *within Judaism* before Christianity adopted it.

**The Takeaway:**
The three Jewish sects map onto later Christian positions: Essenes → Calvinism, Pharisees → Arminianism, Sadducees → radical free-will theology. The debate is not new. It predates Christianity by centuries.

## VI. The Question Behind the Question

The deeper issue is not which view is "right" but what kind of reality God created:

**Option A — The Eternal Now (Block Universe):**
Past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. Time is like a landscape — it's all "there," and we simply move through it. God sees the whole landscape at once. The future is as real and fixed as the past. Free will is compatible with this because our choices are genuinely ours, even though God sees them timelessly (the way seeing someone walk doesn't cause them to walk).

**Option B — The Open Present (Growing Universe):**
Only the present exists. The past is fixed, the future is genuinely open — not yet real, not yet determined. God exists *in* time (or at least interacts with it temporally), possessing perfect knowledge of everything that exists (past and present) and perfect wisdom about what may come. He has more power and intelligence than any creature, but the future unfolds for Him as it does for us — because there is nothing "there" yet to know.

**Option C — The Middle Ground:**
God knows all *possibilities* exhaustively and knows which possibilities will be actualized by free creatures (Molinism/middle knowledge). Or: God is timeless in His essence but freely chooses to engage with creation temporally — genuinely responding, genuinely relenting, genuinely grieving.

### What Scripture Seems to Show

The Bible presents a God who:
- **Declares the end from the beginning** (Isaiah 46:10) — suggesting knowledge of the future
- **Names individuals by name before they are born** (Isaiah 44:28 — Cyrus; Micah 5:2 — Bethlehem) — suggesting precise foreknowledge of specific future persons
- **Wrote all our days before we were born** (Psalm 139:16) — suggesting the future is already present to God
- **Planned the cross before creation**, naming the specific human actors involved (Acts 2:23, Acts 4:27-28, 1 Peter 1:20) — suggesting even free human choices fall within God's pre-temporal decree
- **Chose His people before the foundation of the world** (Ephesians 1:4) — suggesting election precedes human response
- **Guarantees** certain future events unconditionally (Christ's return, final judgment) — suggesting settled foreknowledge
- **Changes His mind** when people repent (Jonah 3:10) — suggesting genuine responsiveness
- **Tests** people to "know" what they will do (Genesis 22:12, Deuteronomy 8:2) — suggesting discovery
- **Makes conditional promises** that depend on human response (Jeremiah 18:7-10) — suggesting open outcomes
- **Asks questions** He seemingly doesn't know the answer to: "Where are you?" (Genesis 3:9), "What have you done?" (Genesis 4:10)
- **Grieves** over outcomes that seem to genuinely surprise or sadden Him (Genesis 6:6)

The data resists systematic resolution. Each tradition emphasizes some passages and explains away others.

---

## VII. Interpretive Perspectives

**On Acts 4:27-28 — Herod and Pilate did what God "determined before to be done":**
- *Classical:* God's eternal decree determined the specific actions of specific free agents. Human choice and divine foreordination are not contradictory — God works *through* human choices without eliminating them. This is the strongest biblical text for the classical view: named individuals, named actions, described as predetermined.
- *Arminian:* God foreknew what Herod and Pilate would freely choose, and His eternal purpose incorporated those choices. "Determined before" describes God's foreknowledge and intention, not strict causal determination.
- *Open:* God planned that the Messiah would suffer and die; the general outcome was predetermined, but the specific human actors were not. "Determined before" refers to the redemptive purpose, not to the free choices of Herod or Pilate individually.

**On Genesis 6:6 — "The LORD regretted that He had made man":**
- *Classical:* Anthropopathism. God did not actually experience surprise or regret. This describes His just response to sin in language we understand.
- *Arminian:* God genuinely grieves over human evil, even though He foreknew it. Foreknowledge does not eliminate emotional engagement.
- *Open:* God genuinely regrets creating humanity. He did not foresee with certainty how deeply they would fall. His grief is real surprise and real sorrow.

**On Exodus 32:14 — Moses's intercession changes God's plan:**
- *Classical:* God always intended to spare Israel. The "threat" was pedagogical, drawing out Moses's intercessory role. God's eternal plan included both the threat and the relenting.
- *Arminian:* God's threat was genuinely conditional. Moses's prayer was a real factor that God foreknew but did not predetermine. Intercession matters.
- *Open:* Moses's prayer genuinely changed God's course of action. God was really going to destroy Israel. Moses's argument was persuasive. God changed His mind.

**On 1 Samuel 15:11, 29 — God both regrets and does not relent:**
- *Classical:* Verse 29 is the theological principle; verse 11 is accommodation. What God *is* (unchanging) takes precedence over how He *appears to us* (regretting).
- *Arminian:* Verse 11 describes God's genuine emotional response to Saul's failure. Verse 29 describes God's unchanging *purpose* — He will not reverse His decision to remove Saul.
- *Open:* Verse 11 describes real divine regret. Verse 29 means God will not change His mind *about this specific decision* (removing Saul), not that He never changes His mind about anything.

## VIII. Why It Matters

This is not an abstract philosophical puzzle. How we answer "Does God interact with time?" shapes:

**Prayer:** If the future is settled, does prayer change anything? Or is it just aligning our will with what God already decided? If the future is open, prayer is a genuine factor in what happens next.

**Suffering:** If God foresaw every tragedy before creation and created anyway, how do we understand His compassion? If God walks through time with us, His grief is real grief, His comfort is present-tense solidarity.

**Relationship:** Can you have a genuine relationship with a being who already knows every word you'll say and every choice you'll make? Or does real relationship require genuine give-and-take, where both parties are affected by the other?

**Hope:** If the future is already "there," our hope is in something God has already seen and secured. If the future is genuinely open, our hope is in God's character — His faithfulness, power, and love — not in a predetermined script.

> "Who knows? He may turn and relent." (**Joel 2:14**, NIV)

That "who knows?" may be the most honest theology in the Bible. Not certainty about God's inner workings. Not a systematic theory of divine temporality. Just the hope that the Living God, who grieves over evil and delights in mercy, might act — and the courage to cry out to Him anyway.
