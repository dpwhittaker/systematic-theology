# Jesus: What Does It Mean to Be the Son of God?
## A Spirit Christology Perspective

*This document represents one voice in a collaborative handout. The author is a first-century Jewish believer in Jesus as Messiah and Lord who understands Jesus's sonship through the lens of the Spirit's anointing rather than through the fourth-century Greek philosophical categories of Nicene Trinitarianism. This is not a liberal skeptic's view — it is a deeply committed reading of Scripture through a Jewish lens.*

## 1. Guardrails — The Outer Limits

Before we discuss how Jesus is the Son of God, we must establish what every Christian must affirm regardless of Christological framework. These are not disputed matters. They are the core of the faith.

**Jesus is the promised Messiah of Israel.**
Every prophecy spoken of the Davidic king — the anointed one who would come to deliver God's people — is fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. He is not one messiah among many. He is the Messiah, the singular hope of Israel and the world.

> "Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified." (**Acts 2:36**, ESV)

**Jesus bodily rose from the dead.**
The resurrection is not a symbol or a spiritual metaphor. God raised the body of Jesus from the tomb. Witnesses ate with Him, touched Him, heard Him teach for forty days. The resurrection is the vindication of everything Jesus claimed and everything God promised. Without it, there is no Christianity.

> "This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses." (**Acts 2:32**, ESV)

**Jesus is Lord — exalted to God's right hand with all authority.**
After His resurrection and ascension, Jesus was enthroned at the right hand of the Father, receiving the name above every name. All authority in heaven and on earth belongs to Him. Every knee will bow.

> "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God... God has made him both Lord and Christ." (**Acts 2:33, 36**, ESV)

**Jesus is the unique Son of God — not simply "a" son as all believers are sons, but THE Son in a category of His own.**
Believers receive the Spirit of adoption and are called sons and daughters of God (Romans 8:14-16). But this is not what Jesus is. He is Son in a way that is categorically distinct — the one through whom all others receive sonship. He is the firstborn, the beloved, the only Son. Whatever framework we use to explain this, the uniqueness must be preserved.

> "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation." (**Colossians 1:15**, ESV)

**Jesus is the definitive and final revelation of God's character.**
God spoke through prophets in many ways, but in these last days He has spoken through His Son. To see Jesus is to see the Father. His words are God's words. His deeds reveal who God is. No subsequent revelation supersedes or corrects Him.

> "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son." (**Hebrews 1:1-2**, ESV)

**Salvation comes through Jesus alone.**
There is no other name under heaven by which we must be saved. Jesus is not one path among many to God. He is the way, the truth, and the life.

> "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." (**Acts 4:12**, ESV)

**Jesus is the righteous judge of the living and the dead.**
God has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom He has appointed — and He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead. The authority to judge belongs to the Son.

> "He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead." (**Acts 10:42**, ESV)

## 2. The Spirit Christology View: What Does "Son of God" Mean?

I want to be clear about what I am arguing and what I am not.

I am not arguing that Jesus is merely a good man, a great teacher, or a powerful prophet. I am not arguing that He is one savior among several. I am arguing that the earliest layer of New Testament Christology — the sermons in the book of Acts, the opening of Romans, the Synoptic Gospels' account of the baptism — presents Jesus's identity as Son of God through the framework of the Spirit's anointing, not through the later Greek philosophical framework of eternal ontological substance.

The Greek framework asks: *What is Jesus made of?* It answers with substance-language: of one substance with the Father, eternally begotten, the second person of the Trinity.

The Hebrew framework asks: *What did God do through Jesus, and what did God declare Jesus to be?* It answers with event-language: God anointed Him with the Spirit, God declared Him His Son at the Jordan, God raised Him from the dead and exalted Him as Lord.

Both want to affirm Jesus's full divine significance. But they use entirely different categories to do it.

### The Spirit's Role in Jesus's Identity

The evidence for understanding Jesus's sonship through the Spirit's anointing is not scattered or peripheral. It is the dominant framing of the earliest Christian preaching.

**Luke 1:35 — Sonship Linked to the Spirit at Conception**

> "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy — the Son of God." (ESV)

Notice the logic here. The angel does not say Jesus is the Son of God because He was eternally begotten before the worlds began. The angel says the child will be called the Son of God *because* the Holy Spirit will come upon Mary and the power of the Most High will overshadow her. The Spirit's action is the ground of the title. Sonship is explained by what the Spirit does, not by what the eternal Logos already is.

**Luke 3:21-22 — The Spirit Descends; the Voice Declares**

> "Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, 'You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.'" (ESV)

This is the public inauguration of Jesus's ministry. The Spirit descends. God speaks. The declaration "You are my beloved Son" comes precisely at the moment the Spirit comes upon Jesus. For a first-century Jewish reader, this is not a metaphysical announcement — it is an anointing scene. God is publicly identifying and commissioning His agent, just as prophets and kings were identified and commissioned in the Hebrew Bible.

Consider David: anointed by Samuel, the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him from that day forward (1 Samuel 16:13). David is not thereby God in the metaphysical sense. But he is God's chosen, empowered, indwelt representative — the anointed one. Jesus is that, and infinitely more.

**Luke 4:14, 18-19 — The Entire Ministry Powered by the Spirit**

> "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee... The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." (ESV)

When Jesus stands in the synagogue at Nazareth and reads from Isaiah 61, He is not offering a philosophical statement about His ontological nature. He is declaring His anointing — the Spirit upon Him, the Spirit through whom He acts, the Spirit that defines His mission. He returns from the wilderness "in the power of the Spirit." His miracles are the Spirit's miracles performed through Him.

**Acts 10:38 — Peter's Summary of the Entire Ministry**

> "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him." (ESV)

This is Peter explaining Jesus to Cornelius — a Gentile who needs to understand who Jesus is from the beginning. Peter does not begin with eternal pre-existence. He does not say, "The second person of the Trinity put on flesh." He says: *God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.* This is Spirit Christology in its most concentrated form: Jesus is who He is because of what God did through the Spirit.

**Acts 2:22 — A Man Attested by God**

> "Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know." (ESV)

Peter again. This is the first Christian sermon, preached fifty days after the resurrection to a crowd in Jerusalem. The man who walked with Jesus, who saw the transfiguration, who witnessed the empty tomb — this man describes Jesus as "a man attested by God." Not as the second member of the Trinity explaining what the eternal Logos did through the human nature. A man. Attested. By God. Through mighty works.

**Acts 2:36 — God *Made* Him Lord and Christ**

> "Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified." (ESV)

The Greek word is *epoiesen* — made, appointed, constituted. God *made* Jesus Lord and Christ through the resurrection and exaltation. This is not a statement about eternal generation or pre-temporal decree in the way later Nicene theology would frame it. It is a declaration about what God *did* in history — what the resurrection accomplished and confirmed. Jesus is Lord because God made Him Lord.

I am not arguing this means He became something He was not before. I am arguing that the categories being used here are functional, relational, and historical — not Greek ontological.

**Romans 1:3-4 — Declared Son by the Spirit of Holiness Through the Resurrection**

> "...the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord." (ESV)

This is remarkable. Paul opens his greatest letter with a statement about Jesus that many scholars believe is a pre-Pauline creedal formula — among the oldest statements of Christian faith we possess. The structure is clear:

- According to the flesh: Son of David (human lineage)
- According to the Spirit of holiness: Son of God in power

The resurrection, by the Spirit, is the ground of the declaration. The Spirit of holiness declares Him Son. Whatever Paul believed about Jesus's pre-existence (and Paul clearly believed much more than this passage alone contains), he chose to open the letter to Rome with a Christology grounded in the Spirit and the resurrection.

### How This Differs from Nicene Trinitarianism

The Nicene framework, hammered out at the Councils of Nicaea (325 AD) and Constantinople (381 AD), answers the question: *What is the eternal, ontological nature of Jesus in relation to the Father?* The answer: He is *homoousios* — of the same substance. Eternally begotten, not made. The second person of the Trinity.

These are Greek philosophical categories — *ousia* (substance), *hypostasis* (person), *homoousios* (same substance). They are borrowed from Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy to answer questions the Hebrew Bible was not trying to answer.

I am not saying these answers are wrong. I am saying they are answers to Greek questions, not Hebrew questions.

The Hebrew question is not "What is Jesus's substance?" The Hebrew question is "Who has God made this man to be, and what has God done through Him?" When Jesus heals the sick, raises the dead, forgives sins, commands the wind — the Hebrew mind asks: *What authority has God given this man? By what Spirit does He act?* The answer is not Greek metaphysics. It is: *God anointed Him. God was with Him. The Spirit of the Lord was upon Him.*

**On "Lord" (Kurios) and Psalm 110:1**

I want to address one of the strongest arguments for Nicene Christology head-on.

When the New Testament calls Jesus "Lord" (*Kurios*), it uses the same Greek word the Septuagint uses for YHWH. Calling Jesus *Kurios* appears to be identifying Jesus as YHWH.

But Psalm 110:1 — the most-quoted Old Testament text in the New Testament — says:

> "The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (ESV)

In Hebrew: *YHWH* says to my *Adon* (lord, master). Jesus Himself uses this psalm to stump the Pharisees (Mark 12:35-37), pointing out that David calls the Messiah "my Lord." The Messiah is David's son — but also David's Lord. A greater figure than David.

The important point for my argument: *Kurios* does not necessarily mean "YHWH Himself in the flesh." In both Greek and Hebrew usage, *kurios/adon* can mean an exalted lord, a ruler given supreme authority, one who holds YHWH's delegated power. When God exalts Jesus and gives Him "the name above every name" (Philippians 2:9), He is enthroning Him as supreme Lord over all creation — the one to whom all authority has been delegated. This is what Psalm 110 describes: YHWH enthroning the Messianic Lord at His right hand.

This is an extraordinary exaltation. It makes Jesus the supreme Lord of the universe. But the language is the language of exaltation and enthronement, not necessarily the language of ontological identity.

I hold this tension openly. The texts push hard in both directions.

### How This Differs from Arianism

I want to be emphatic here: Spirit Christology is not Arianism, and it is not a halfway house toward Arianism.

Arianism taught that Jesus is a created being — the first and greatest of God's creations, existing before all other things, but nevertheless created. "There was when He was not." The Son had a beginning.

Spirit Christology does not say this. It does not say Jesus is a created lesser god. It does not say He existed before His birth as a created angelic being.

The Arian question — "Is Jesus of created or uncreated substance?" — is itself a Greek question. Spirit Christology steps back from that entire grid. The Hebrew question is not about the metaphysics of Jesus's existence before creation. The Hebrew question is about who God made Him to be through the Spirit, what God did through Him in history, and what God declared Him to be through the resurrection.

If someone pushes me and says, "But was He created or uncreated?" — my honest answer is: that is a Greek philosophical question, and the earliest layers of the New Testament are not answering it. The moment I try to answer it, I have stepped out of the Hebrew framework and into the Greek one, and then the Nicene answers have significant exegetical force.

What I insist on is this: The earliest Christian preaching does not use Arian categories. It does not say Jesus is a lesser god or a created spiritual being. It says He is a man anointed by God, raised by God, exalted by God, and declared Lord and Son by God. That is not Arianism. That is the gospel of Peter, the gospel of Acts, the gospel of the earliest community.

### The "Son of God" Distinction

All believers receive the Spirit of adoption and are called children of God.

> "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God... you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!'" (**Romans 8:14-15**, ESV)

So are we sons of God? Yes. Is Jesus the Son of God? Yes. What is the difference?

**First: Degree of Spirit.** The Gospel of John, even in its high Christology, preserves this distinction: "For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure" (John 3:34, ESV). Believers receive the Spirit in measure. Jesus received the Spirit *without measure* — the full, unlimited presence and power of God dwelling in and through Him.

**Second: Unique role and mission.** Jesus is not merely one Spirit-filled person among many. He is the one through whom all others receive the Spirit (Acts 2:33 — "Having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing"). He is the source through whom the Spirit flows to the church. His sonship is constitutive; ours is derivative.

**Third: Unique resurrection and exaltation.** Believers will share in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus was raised first — the firstborn from the dead (Colossians 1:18), the firstfruits (1 Corinthians 15:20). His resurrection and exaltation to God's right hand gave Him a position and authority that no other human being holds. "Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named" (Ephesians 1:21, ESV).

**Fourth: Sinlessness and perfect obedience.** Every believer needs the Spirit to overcome sin and move toward holiness. Jesus was "tempted as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15, ESV). The Spirit could rest fully on Him and act fully through Him in a way that is not possible for sinful human beings. His unique holiness is part of what makes His sonship unique.

The difference between Jesus's sonship and ours is not that we are sons by adoption and He is Son by Greek ontological category. It is that His anointing was complete, His obedience was perfect, His mission was singular, His resurrection was first, and His exaltation is supreme.

## 3. Honest Tensions — Where My Framework Is Under Pressure

I am a follower of truth before I am an advocate for any theological system. These passages press hard on my framework, and I want to acknowledge them honestly.

### John 1:1 — "The Word Was God"

> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (**John 1:1**, ESV)

And verse 14: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."

This is the strongest single text for high, pre-existence Christology. John is clearly drawing on both Greek *Logos* philosophy and Hebrew *Memra* (the Word of God that acts in creation and history). "In the beginning" echoes Genesis 1:1. The Word is pre-existent. The Word is with God. The Word *is* God. And this Word became flesh.

My framework must grapple with this honestly. John's Gospel is not Acts. The Christology is higher, the language is more explicitly divine, and the pre-existence is not incidental to the argument — it is the entire opening movement of the book.

The most honest thing I can say is this: John 1 represents a more developed Christology than Acts 2 or Romans 1:3-4. Whether this development is organic and Spirit-led (deepening understanding of who Jesus was), or whether it represents a theological move that introduces Greek categories into what was originally a simpler Jewish framework — that is the question I hold with open hands.

I do not deny that John 1 says what it says. I note that John himself does not use the Nicene philosophical apparatus to explain it. "The Word became flesh" is a testimony to an event, not a philosophical thesis about eternal substance.

### Philippians 2:5-11 — Pre-existence Language

> "Though he was in the form of God, he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men." (**Philippians 2:6-7**, ESV)

"In the form of God" (*en morphe theou*) before the incarnation — this text seems to point to a pre-existent divine identity that was voluntarily set aside or veiled in the incarnation.

My honest response: Yes, this pushes toward pre-existence. Whether "form of God" means "eternal divine nature" in the Nicene sense, or something more like "bearing the image and likeness of God in a unique way," is a genuine exegetical debate. But I will not pretend the text is comfortable for my framework. Paul is describing a movement *from* a divine status *to* human form. That is hard to explain without some form of pre-existence.

I hold this passage with more tension than I hold Acts.

### Colossians 1:15-17 — All Things Created Through Him

> "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible... all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together." (**Colossians 1:15-17**, ESV)

This is the most difficult passage for any low-Christology reading. If all things were created through Jesus, He cannot be a creature. He must be on the Creator side of the Creator/creature divide. He is "before all things." He holds all things together. This sounds like the eternal Logos mediating creation — not a first-century anointed human.

My honest response: If this text is authentically Pauline (some scholars debate Colossians's authorship, though I take no strong position), it represents a Christology that is pressing well beyond Spirit-anointing categories. "All things created through him" is not the language of Acts 2. It is the language of John 1. It places Jesus on the divine side of creation in a way that my framework handles with difficulty.

I do not resolve this tension by dismissing the text. I hold it as evidence that the New Testament itself may be developing Christologically — that the earliest sermons in Acts represent one moment in the community's understanding, and John and Colossians represent a deepening that may or may not be captured adequately by Spirit Christology alone.

### Is There a Development from "Low" to "High" Christology Within the New Testament?

Many scholars argue yes: the earliest material (Q, early Paul, Acts sermons) presents a functional/adoptionist Christology; the later material (John, Colossians, Hebrews) presents a higher, pre-existence Christology.

I want to be careful here because this framework can be used in theologically destructive ways — as if the "real" Jesus is the early, low Christology, and the high Christology is later distortion. That is not my position.

My position is more modest: the same community that worshipped Jesus from the earliest days (Maranatha — "Come, Lord!" — is Aramaic, the language of the earliest Jewish Christians) expressed that devotion through increasingly rich theological categories as they wrestled with who Jesus was. The Acts sermons describe what happened. John and Colossians reflect more deeply on what it means. Both are Scripture. Both are authoritative. The Spirit was leading them into all truth (John 16:13).

What I resist is the leap from this biblical development to the fully formalized Greek metaphysics of Nicaea. The New Testament writers were Jewish thinkers using a mixture of Hebrew and Greek concepts to express something that broke every previous category. The Nicene council used Greek philosophy to systematize what they found in the New Testament. That systematization may be helpful. It may also have introduced precision where the New Testament preferred mystery.

## 4. Applications — Common Ground for All Christians

Whatever our Christological framework, these convictions unite us.

**Jesus is not merely a teacher or an example.** His life is not primarily a moral model to imitate. He came to accomplish something we could not accomplish ourselves — to live the life we should have lived, to bear what we deserved to bear, and to open a way to God that was otherwise closed. He must be more than a good man for any of this to work.

**Jesus's full humanity is essential, not incidental.** He was born, grew, hungered, wept, suffered, and died. He was not playing at being human. He entered our condition entirely. This is the ground of the gospel — not that an untouchable God reached down from a safe distance, but that God entered the mess, bore it from the inside, and came out the other side.

**The resurrection is the hinge of everything.** Without a bodily resurrection, there is no Christianity. There is no forgiveness, no hope, no Lord. Paul is explicit: "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17, ESV). Every Christological framework must account for the resurrection as a real, bodily, historical event — not as symbol or metaphor.

**Jesus is Lord now.** He is not waiting to become Lord. He is not a Lord-elect pending His second coming. He was enthroned at the right hand of the Father after the resurrection and ascension. All authority belongs to Him now. That means His kingdom claims are present claims on our lives now — not future claims we can defer until He returns.

**Salvation is personal and relational.** Regardless of whether we explain Jesus's relationship to the Father in Nicene ontological terms or in Hebrew anointing terms, the gospel is not primarily a doctrinal system to be understood but a relationship to be entered. "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31, ESV). Saving faith is trust in a Person, not assent to a formula.

**Jesus is the definitive word about who God is.** If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus. He does not correct the Old Testament picture of God — He fulfills it. He does not reveal a God different from the God of Israel — He reveals that the God of Israel is even more radically present, more radically loving, more radically committed to His people than anyone had imagined. "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9, ESV).

**We await His return.** Maranatha — "Come, Lord Jesus." The same community that prayed this prayer in Aramaic in the first generation still prays it today. History is not cycling endlessly. It is moving toward a consummation when Jesus returns to judge the living and the dead and to establish the kingdom of God in its fullness. We live in the already-not-yet — the kingdom has come in Jesus's first coming, and it will come fully in His second.

**The Spirit He poured out is the guarantee.** Jesus ascended and poured out the Spirit on His community (Acts 2:33). The Spirit dwelling in believers is the down payment, the firstfruits, the guarantee of the coming resurrection and full redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14). The Spirit in us now is the same Spirit that was in Jesus without measure — the Spirit that raised Him from the dead will give life to our mortal bodies (Romans 8:11).
