## I. The Origin and Authority of Scripture

### Passages

**2 Timothy 3:14-17** (ESV)
> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. **All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.**

**2 Peter 1:19-21** (ESV)
> And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

**Isaiah 40:6-8** (ESV)
> A voice says, "Cry!"
> And I said, "What shall I cry?"
> All flesh is grass,
> and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
> The grass withers, the flower fades
> when the breath of the LORD blows on it;
> surely the people are grass.
> The grass withers, the flower fades,
> but the word of our God will stand forever.

**Psalm 119:89** (ESV)
> Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.

**Matthew 24:35** (ESV)
> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

**1 Peter 1:23-25** (ESV)
> since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for
> "All flesh is like grass
> and all its glory like the flower of grass.
> The grass withers,
> and the flower falls,
> but the word of the Lord remains forever."
> And this word is the good news that was preached to you.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Divine Inspiration (2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:21):**
- **Plenary Verbal Inspiration view:** Every word of Scripture is directly inspired by God; "breathed out by God" (*theopneustos*) and "carried along by the Holy Spirit" indicate divine superintendence extending to the very words chosen. Human authors were instruments through whom God spoke precisely what He intended.
- **Dynamic Inspiration view:** God worked through human authors' personalities, vocabularies, and cultural contexts while ensuring the message He intended was communicated. The focus is on the truthfulness and reliability of the message rather than dictation of words.
- **Functional view:** Emphasizes the practical outcome ("profitable for teaching...") rather than making systematic claims about the mechanics of inspiration. The focus is what Scripture does (equips for good works) rather than how it was produced.

**On the Scope of "All Scripture":**
- **Old Testament only:** In 2 Timothy, "sacred writings" Timothy knew from childhood refers specifically to the Old Testament, so "all Scripture" means the Hebrew Bible.
- **Progressive inclusion:** While originally referring to the OT, the principle extends to apostolic writings as the New Testament canon was recognized (supported by 2 Pet 3:15-16's reference to Paul's letters as Scripture).
- **Comprehensive:** "All Scripture" means every part of the biblical canon, however it's defined by various traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox canons differ).

**On the Eternal Nature of God's Word:**
- **Application to written Scripture:** Passages about the eternal word (Isa 40:8, Matt 24:35, 1 Pet 1:25) guarantee the permanent validity and preservation of the biblical text.
- **Primary reference to God's decree/promise:** "Word of our God" in Isaiah primarily refers to God's promise of restoration; application to written Scripture is secondary or derivative.
- **Christological focus:** In Matthew 24:35, "my words" refers specifically to Jesus' teachings; the broader application to all Scripture is inferential.
- **Gospel message emphasis:** 1 Peter explicitly identifies "the word" with "the good news that was preached"—emphasizing the gospel content rather than the text itself.

## II. The Sufficiency of Scripture

### Passages

**Deuteronomy 4:2** (ESV)
> You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.

**Deuteronomy 12:32** (ESV)
> Everything that I command you, you shall be careful to do. You shall not add to it or take from it.

**Proverbs 30:5-6** (ESV)
> Every word of God proves true;
> he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
> Do not add to his words,
> lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.

**Revelation 22:18-19** (ESV)
> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.

**1 Corinthians 4:6** (ESV)
> I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.

**Galatians 1:8-9** (ESV)
> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Commands Not to Add or Subtract:**
- **Canon closure view:** These passages establish a principle that God's revelation is complete and no additions are permitted. Deuteronomy protected the Mosaic Law; Revelation 22 closes the biblical canon. The warnings extend beyond their immediate contexts to protect all Scripture from human tampering.
- **Contextual protection view:** Each passage addresses its specific context: Deuteronomy protects the Mosaic covenant within its historical setting; Revelation protects John's apocalyptic prophecy from alteration. These don't necessarily prohibit further divine revelation (since more Scripture came after Deuteronomy), but do prohibit human distortion of what God has spoken.
- **Covenantal framework view:** The warnings function within their respective covenant contexts—don't add to the Law of Moses; don't add to the prophecy of Revelation. They don't directly address the question of ongoing revelation or canon formation.

**On Scripture's Sufficiency:**
- **Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone):** Scripture contains everything necessary for salvation and Christian life. 2 Timothy 3:17 ("complete, equipped for every good work") teaches that Scripture is sufficient for faith and practice. Tradition and church authority are subordinate to Scripture. "Not to go beyond what is written" (1 Cor 4:6) establishes Scripture as the sole ultimate authority.
- **Prima Scriptura (Scripture First):** Scripture is the primary and supreme authority, but not the only authority. Church tradition, reason, and experience play legitimate roles in understanding and applying God's will. 2 Timothy 3:17 addresses ministerial preparation, not all sources of knowledge. Galatians 1:8-9 protects the gospel core but doesn't exclude all extrabiblical authority.
- **Three-Source view (Scripture, Tradition, Magisterium):** Scripture is materially sufficient (contains all necessary truths) but requires the interpretive authority of the Church. "What is written" in 1 Corinthians may refer to Scripture generally or to specific quotations in that letter—it doesn't establish sola scriptura. The apostolic teaching mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:15 includes oral tradition handed down through the church.

**On the Gospel's Protection (Galatians 1:8-9):**
- **Broad doctrinal application:** This anathema applies to all theological error and establishes Scripture (the written gospel) as the final arbiter of truth.
- **Gospel-specific application:** Paul's strong language protects the specific doctrine of justification by faith alone against the Judaizers. It establishes the gospel's inviolability but doesn't necessarily address all doctrinal questions or the role of tradition in other areas.

## III. The Power and Effectiveness of God's Word

### Passages

**Hebrews 4:12-13** (ESV)
> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.

**Isaiah 55:10-11** (ESV)
> For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven
> and do not return there but water the earth,
> making it bring forth and sprout,
> giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
> so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;
> it shall not return to me empty,
> but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
> and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

**1 Thessalonians 2:13** (ESV)
> And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.

**Romans 15:4** (ESV)
> For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

**1 Corinthians 10:11** (ESV)
> Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.

**John 20:30-31** (ESV)
> Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On "The Word of God is Living and Active" (Hebrews 4:12-13):**
- **Written Scripture view:** "The word of God" refers to the biblical text, which has inherent power to search hearts and convict consciences. The "living" quality distinguishes Scripture from dead letters—it's dynamic and transformative.
- **Spoken word/gospel message view:** "Word of God" is the proclaimed message, whether written or oral. The emphasis is on God's communication generally, not the text specifically.
- **Christological view:** The transition to "his sight" in v. 13 and the context of Hebrews (Christ as high priest) suggest "the word" may be Christ Himself, the Logos, whose gaze penetrates all things.
- **Multivalent view:** The term encompasses written Scripture, spoken message, and Christ—all dimensions of God's self-revelation. The author doesn't distinguish sharply between them.

**On the Certainty of God's Word Accomplishing Its Purpose (Isaiah 55:10-11):**
- **Prophetic proclamation emphasis:** "My word that goes out from my mouth" primarily refers to Isaiah's prophecies and God's promises of restoration. The certainty is about God's specific redemptive purposes being fulfilled.
- **Scripture's efficacy:** This passage guarantees that Scripture, when proclaimed and read, will accomplish God's purposes. It will not fail to produce the fruit God intends.
- **Divine sovereignty in salvation:** God's word will infallibly accomplish His saving purposes—the elect will respond, hearts will be changed. This is less about Scripture's properties and more about God's sovereign effectiveness.

**On Scripture's Transforming Work:**
- **Instrumental means of grace view:** Scripture is the primary instrument the Spirit uses to bring about spiritual transformation ("at work in you believers"). Reading, hearing, and meditating on Scripture is essential for sanctification.
- **Content emphasis:** What matters is the message/content (the gospel, God's promises) rather than the text itself. The word works because of what it communicates about Christ.
- **Sacramental view:** Scripture functions as a means of grace alongside sacraments. It mediates God's presence and power to believers.

**On Scripture's Purpose (John 20:30-31):**
- **Selectivity and sufficiency compatible:** John acknowledges he didn't record everything Jesus did, showing Scripture is selective. But what is written is sufficient for faith and life in Christ. God curated what we need.
- **Sufficiency questioned:** If much was not written, how can we be certain Scripture contains everything necessary? This raises questions about oral tradition and the church's role in preserving the full apostolic witness.
- **Evangelistic focus:** The purpose is belief leading to salvation. This defines Scripture's primary function—not exhaustive biography but saving testimony.

## IV. The Clarity and Understandability of Scripture

### Passages

**Psalm 119:105** (ESV)
> Your word is a lamp to my feet
> and a light to my path.

**Psalm 119:130** (ESV)
> The unfolding of your words gives light;
> it imparts understanding to the simple.

**Proverbs 6:23** (ESV)
> For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,
> and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life.

**2 Peter 1:19** (ESV)
> And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

**Acts 17:11** (ESV)
> Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.

**Nehemiah 8:8** (ESV)
> They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.

**Luke 24:27, 32, 45** (ESV)
> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself... They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"... Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Scripture as Light:**
- **Perspicuity (Clarity) view:** Scripture is clear and understandable to ordinary believers. The "simple" can understand (Ps 119:130). While some passages are difficult (2 Pet 3:16), the essential message of salvation is plain. The Holy Spirit illuminates believers to understand Scripture, but this doesn't mean Scripture is obscure—it means spiritually resistant hearts are opened.
- **Need for teaching/interpretation:** The light imagery shows Scripture is beneficial, but passages like Nehemiah 8:8 ("gave the sense") and Luke 24:27 (Jesus "interpreted") show interpretation and explanation are necessary. The Bereans (Acts 17:11) were noble for examining Scripture, but they still needed teaching to examine.
- **Progressive clarity view:** "Until the day dawns" (2 Pet 1:19) suggests Scripture's light is real but provisional or partial. Fuller understanding comes eschatologically or through the Spirit's illumination over time.

**On the Role of Teachers and Interpretation:**
- **Teaching aids clarity, doesn't create it:** Scripture is clear in itself; teachers help readers see what's already there. The Levites in Nehemiah explained clearly; they didn't add hidden meaning. Jesus opened the disciples' minds to see what Scripture already taught about Him.
- **Authoritative interpretation required:** Nehemiah 8:8 and Luke 24:45 show that understanding Scripture requires authoritative interpretation. The church's teaching office explains Scripture; private interpretation is insufficient or dangerous (cf. 2 Pet 1:20).
- **Translation and contextualization needed:** Nehemiah 8:8 likely describes translation from Hebrew to Aramaic and cultural explanation. Similarly, teachers today bridge linguistic and cultural gaps. This doesn't mean Scripture is unclear, but that it requires historical understanding.

**On Pre- vs. Post-Pentecost Understanding:**
- **The Spirit's work post-Pentecost:** Luke 24 describes pre-Pentecost confusion; after Pentecost (Acts 2), the Spirit enables believers to understand Scripture. The apostles who were confused before the resurrection became bold proclaimers after receiving the Spirit.
- **Christological key essential:** Even post-Pentecost, Scripture can only be rightly understood when read christocentrically. Jesus is the hermeneutical key (Luke 24:27). Without seeing Christ in Scripture, one misses its main point.

## V. The Preservation and Permanence of Scripture

### Passages

**Matthew 5:18** (ESV)
> For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.

**Psalm 12:6-7** (ESV)
> The words of the LORD are pure words,
> like silver refined in a furnace on the ground,
> purified seven times.
> You, O LORD, will keep them;
> you will guard us from this generation forever.

**Psalm 119:152** (ESV)
> Long have I known from your testimonies
> that you have founded them forever.

**Psalm 119:160** (ESV)
> The sum of your word is truth,
> and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On the Preservation of Scripture's Text:**
- **Textual preservation guaranteed:** God has supernaturally preserved the biblical text through copyist transmission. Psalm 12:6-7 ("You will keep them") promises preservation of God's words. Matthew 5:18 ("not an iota, not a dot will pass") guarantees the text's integrity down to the smallest marks.
- **Providential preservation (not perfect):** God has providentially overseen the transmission of Scripture through faithful copyists, but this doesn't mean zero textual variants. The text is reliably preserved in the manuscript tradition, but we don't have perfect originals. Textual criticism helps recover the original.
- **Preservation of message, not letter:** What's preserved is the truthfulness and authority of God's revelation, not necessarily every jot and tittle of the manuscript tradition. The meaning and message endure, even if minor textual variations exist.
- **Hebrew grammar debate (Psalm 12:7):** Modern translations often render this as "You will preserve us" (referring to people) rather than "preserve them" (God's words), based on Hebrew pronoun forms. The promise may be about protecting God's people from the wicked generation, not about textual preservation.

**On the Law's Permanence (Matthew 5:18):**
- **Moral law endures:** The moral principles of God's law remain permanently valid. Jesus affirms the ongoing authority of God's moral standards while fulfilling the ceremonial and civil aspects.
- **Entire Mosaic Law until Christ:** "Until all is accomplished" refers to Christ's fulfilling work. Until the cross and resurrection, every detail of the Law remained in force. After Christ's accomplishment, the Law's function changes (fulfilled, not abolished).
- **Ongoing validity of Torah:** The Law remains authoritative for believers, though understood through Christ. "Until heaven and earth pass away" indicates permanence beyond Christ's earthly ministry.
- **Hyperbolic emphasis on authority:** Jesus uses dramatic language to affirm the Law's authority against those who would discard it. The specific question of what "until all is accomplished" means is secondary to the main point: Jesus upholds the Law.

## VI. The Nature and Character of Scripture

### Passages

**John 17:17** (ESV)
> Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.

**Psalm 119:142, 151** (ESV)
> Your righteousness is righteous forever,
> and your law is true...
> But you are near, O LORD,
> and all your commandments are true.

**Proverbs 30:5** (ESV)
> Every word of God proves true;
> he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.

**Psalm 19:7-11** (ESV)
> The law of the LORD is perfect,
> reviving the soul;
> the testimony of the LORD is sure,
> making wise the simple;
> the precepts of the LORD are right,
> rejoicing the heart;
> the commandment of the LORD is pure,
> enlightening the eyes;
> the fear of the LORD is clean,
> enduring forever;
> the rules of the LORD are true,
> and righteous altogether.
> More to be desired are they than gold,
> even much fine gold;
> sweeter also than honey
> and drippings of the honeycomb.
> Moreover, by them is your servant warned;
> in keeping them there is great reward.

**Psalm 12:6** (ESV)
> The words of the LORD are pure words,
> like silver refined in a furnace on the ground,
> purified seven times.

**2 Samuel 22:31** (ESV)
> This God—his way is perfect;
> the word of the LORD proves true;
> he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On "Your Word is Truth" (John 17:17):**
- **Inerrancy view:** Scripture contains no errors in any of its affirmations, whether theological, historical, or scientific. "Your word is truth" means Scripture is truthful in all it asserts. "Every word of God proves true" extends this to each individual word.
- **Infallibility view:** Scripture is completely trustworthy in matters of faith and practice—its salvific and moral teaching is without error. Historical or scientific details may reflect ancient understanding without undermining Scripture's truthfulness in its theological purpose.
- **Relational/covenantal truth:** "Your word is truth" emphasizes God's faithfulness and reliability rather than propositional accuracy. God is true to His word; His promises don't fail. Truth is primarily relational (God reveals Himself truly) rather than propositional.
- **Truth in original autographs:** The original manuscripts were without error; copyist errors in transmission don't undermine the doctrine of Scripture's truthfulness. "Every word of God" refers to God's original inspiration, not necessarily every extant manuscript.

**On Scripture's Perfection and Purity:**
- **Complete and sufficient:** "Perfect" (Ps 19:7—Hebrew *tamim*) means complete, whole, lacking nothing. Scripture needs no additions or corrections; it's fully adequate for its purposes.
- **Character quality emphasis:** The attributes listed in Psalm 19:7-11 (perfect, sure, right, pure, clean, true) emphasize Scripture's reliability and trustworthiness for life and godliness. The focus is pastoral and practical rather than addressing modern debates about inerrancy.
- **Effects as primary:** The passage emphasizes what Scripture does (reviving, making wise, rejoicing, enlightening) more than abstract properties. Scripture's perfection is demonstrated in its transforming effects.

**On Application Beyond Torah:**
- **All Scripture shares these qualities:** Though Psalm 19 and 119 focus on "the law of the LORD" (Torah), the principles apply to all Scripture by extension.
- **Specific to Mosaic Law:** These Psalms celebrate the Torah given to Israel; extending them to all Scripture requires theological warrant beyond the text itself.
- **Progressive revelation:** What was true of the Law is even more true of the fuller revelation in Christ and the New Testament.

## VII. Human Responsibility Toward Scripture

### Passages

**Joshua 1:8** (ESV)
> This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.

**Psalm 1:1-3** (ESV)
> Blessed is the man
> who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
> nor stands in the way of sinners,
> nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
> but his delight is in the law of the LORD,
> and on his law he meditates day and night.
> He is like a tree
> planted by streams of water
> that yields its fruit in its season,
> and its leaf does not wither.
> In all that he does, he prospers.

**Deuteronomy 6:6-9** (ESV)
> And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

**Deuteronomy 11:18-21** (ESV)
> You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.

**James 1:22-25** (ESV)
> But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

**Luke 11:28** (ESV)
> But he said, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!"

**Matthew 4:4** (ESV)
> But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

**Deuteronomy 8:3** (ESV)
> And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Meditation:**
- **Constant engagement with Scripture:** "Day and night" meditation (Josh 1:8, Ps 1:2) means Scripture should permeate all of life through memorization, reflection, and application. "Meditate" (Hebrew *hagah*) involves verbal repetition and deep reflection.
- **Quality over quantity:** The emphasis is on deep, thoughtful engagement with Scripture rather than mere time spent or amount read. Meditation is pondering, not just reading.
- **Covenantal context:** Joshua 1:8 and Deuteronomy passages address Israel under the Mosaic covenant. While the principle of valuing God's word applies to all believers, the specific promises (prosperity in the land) are covenantal.

**On Teaching the Next Generation:**
- **Family discipleship central:** Parents bear primary responsibility for teaching children God's word (Deut 6:6-9; 11:18-21). Faith transmission happens in everyday life contexts ("when you sit...walk...lie down...rise").
- **Church as extended family:** The command extends beyond biological families to the faith community. Older believers teach younger (Titus 2); the church trains the next generation.
- **Literal vs. symbolic practice:** Physical reminders (phylacteries, mezuzot) were taken literally in Jewish practice. Jesus criticized ostentatious external displays (Matt 23:5), suggesting the principle is internal reality expressed appropriately in external practice.

**On Hearing vs. Doing:**
- **Obedience essential:** True knowledge of Scripture requires obedience (James 1:22-25). Intellectual assent without life change is self-deception. The goal is transformation, not merely information.
- **Grace and works:** Some emphasize that obedience flows from grace; we "do the word" because we've been changed by the gospel, not to earn salvation. Others see James emphasizing that true faith necessarily produces works.
- **The "perfect law of liberty":** Identified variously as the Mosaic law rightly understood, Jesus' teaching (especially the Sermon on the Mount), or the gospel/new covenant. "Liberty" indicates freedom from sin and legalism, not freedom to sin.

**On Dependence on God's Word:**
- **Spiritual sustenance:** "Man shall not live by bread alone" (Matt 4:4, Deut 8:3) teaches that physical provision is insufficient; we need God's revelation for true life.
- **Literal application:** Jesus uses Scripture to resist temptation, modeling dependence on God's written word in spiritual warfare.
- **Broader revelation:** "Every word that comes from the mouth of God" includes but isn't limited to written Scripture—God's providential care, ongoing guidance, etc.

## VIII. The Scope and Purpose of Scripture

### Passages

**Luke 24:44-47** (ESV)
> Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem."

**John 5:39-40, 46-47** (ESV)
> You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life... For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?

**Romans 4:23-24** (ESV)
> But the words "it was counted to him" were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord.

**1 Corinthians 9:9-10** (ESV)
> For it is written in the Law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plougher should plough in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Scripture's Christocentric Focus:**
- **All Scripture points to Christ:** Jesus is the subject and goal of all Scripture. The entire Old Testament (Law, Prophets, Psalms—the three divisions) testifies to Christ. Reading Scripture without seeing Christ is missing its central message.
- **Typological/allegorical warrant:** Luke 24:27 and John 5:39 justify finding Christ throughout the OT, even in passages without obvious messianic reference. Typology and spiritual interpretation are validated.
- **Redemptive-historical focus:** Scripture as a whole tells the story of redemption that culminates in Christ. Not every verse is directly about Jesus, but the overall narrative arc points to Him.
- **Minimalist christological reading:** The specific messianic prophecies point to Christ; extending this to every OT text risks eisegesis. Jesus' statement is about the overall testimony, not a mandate to find Jesus in every detail.

**On Scripture's Irony (John 5:39-40):**
- **Bible study insufficient without faith:** The Jewish leaders studied Scripture diligently but missed Christ. Intellectual knowledge doesn't save; personal faith in Christ is required.
- **Scripture's instrumental purpose:** Scripture is a means to Christ, not an end in itself. The goal is relationship with God through Christ, not mastery of the text.
- **False confidence warning:** Religious activity (even Scripture reading) can become a substitute for genuine encounter with God.

**On Scripture Written for Multiple Generations:**
- **Sensus plenior (fuller meaning):** Scripture has meaning beyond what the human author intended or understood. Romans 4:23-24 shows Genesis 15:6 was written not just about Abraham but "for us also."
- **Application beyond original context:** Scripture's relevance transcends its original historical situation. 1 Corinthians 9:9-10 applies an agricultural law to gospel ministry.
- **Original meaning primary:** While application extends to later readers, the original meaning grounds all legitimate application. Paul's use of Deuteronomy 25:4 builds on the literal sense (don't muzzle oxen) to draw out a principle.
- **Hermeneutical method debate:** Does 1 Corinthians 9:9-10 ("Is it for oxen that God is concerned?") teach that the literal sense is secondary to spiritual application, or that the literal sense has broader implications?

## IX. The Old and New Testaments

### Passages

**Matthew 5:17-18** (ESV)
> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.

**Luke 16:16-17** (ESV)
> The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.

**Romans 10:4** (ESV)
> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.

**Jeremiah 31:31-34** (ESV)
> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

**2 Corinthians 3:4-18** (key excerpts) (ESV)
> ...our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life... Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory... will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?... Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it... But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away... And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Christ "Fulfilling" the Law:**
- **Moral law continues, ceremonial fulfilled:** Jesus fulfilled the ceremonial and civil law (sacrifices, temple, theocracy) but the moral law endures. "Fulfill" means bring to completion what they pointed to (Christ is the true sacrifice, temple, king).
- **Entire Mosaic covenant fulfilled:** The Mosaic covenant as a covenant system has been fulfilled and replaced by the new covenant. Believers aren't under the Law of Moses but under the law of Christ (Gal 6:2). Moral principles continue because they reflect God's character, not because the Mosaic covenant continues.
- **Law intensified and internalized:** Jesus doesn't lower the Law's standard but raises it (Matt 5:21-48). "Fulfill" means fill it up with its full meaning and enable obedience through the Spirit.
- **All OT fulfilled in Christ:** "Law and Prophets" encompasses all OT Scripture. Christ fulfills every promise, prophecy, type, and expectation. The OT remains authoritative as it testifies to Christ and His work.

**On the Timing of Fulfillment ("until all is accomplished"):**
- **Accomplished at the cross:** Christ's death and resurrection fulfilled the Law. Believers live post-fulfillment, not under the Mosaic covenant.
- **Accomplished at the end of the age:** The Law remains valid until the eschaton ("until heaven and earth pass away"). We still live under biblical law, though understood through Christ.
- **Progressive accomplishment:** Some aspects fulfilled at the first coming, others awaiting the second coming.

**On "The End of the Law" (Romans 10:4):**
- **Termination:** Christ ended the Law as a covenant system. Believers aren't under Law but under grace (Rom 6:14-15).
- **Goal/Telos:** Christ is the Law's goal or culmination—what it was pointing toward. The Law led to Christ; He completes it.
- **End for righteousness specifically:** Christ ended the Law as a means of justification. The Law's other functions (revealing God's character, guiding sanctification) may continue.

**On the New Covenant and Scripture:**
- **Diminished role for written Scripture:** Jeremiah 31:33-34 ("I will write it on their hearts...no longer shall each one teach") suggests less need for external written law under the new covenant. The Spirit's internal work is primary.
- **Scripture and Spirit cooperate:** The law written on hearts is the same law revealed in Scripture, now internalized by the Spirit. Scripture remains the objective standard; the Spirit applies it inwardly.
- **Still need for teaching:** Despite "no longer shall each one teach," the NT repeatedly emphasizes teachers (Eph 4:11; 1 Tim 3:2; 2 Tim 2:2). The promise refers to universal knowledge of God among covenant members, not elimination of teaching offices.

**On "Letter vs. Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3):**
- **External law vs. internal transformation:** "Letter" refers to the external written code (Mosaic Law); "Spirit" refers to the new covenant's internal transforming work. The old covenant, though glorious, brought death because it revealed sin without providing power to overcome it.
- **Legalism vs. gospel:** "Letter" represents legalistic observance; "Spirit" represents grace and faith. The contrast is between religion as external performance and as heart transformation.
- **Literal vs. spiritual interpretation:** "Letter" is wooden literalism; "Spirit" is spiritual understanding. This relates to hermeneutics—reading the OT christocentrically with spiritual eyes.
- **Old covenant glory surpassed:** Paul doesn't denigrate the old covenant (it was glorious) but exalts the new covenant's greater glory. This is comparative, not absolute dismissal.

## X. Challenges and Difficulties

### Passages

**2 Peter 3:16** (ESV)
> There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.

**Ecclesiastes 1:2, 9** (ESV)
> Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,
> vanity of vanities! All is vanity...
> What has been is what will be,
> and what has been done is what will be done,
> and there is nothing new under the sun.

**Revelation 21:5** (ESV)
> And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." Also he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Difficult Passages:**
- **Humility in interpretation:** Scripture itself acknowledges difficulties, calling for careful, humble interpretation. Not all questions have easy answers; some mysteries remain.
- **Danger of misinterpretation:** The warning about "twisting" Scripture shows interpretation has serious consequences. Faithful reading requires care, community, and the Spirit's help.
- **Progressive understanding:** What seems unclear may become clearer with further study, spiritual maturity, or additional revelation (for the apostles, further NT books; for us, growing understanding).

**On Apparent Contradictions:**
- **Canonical diversity reflects reality:** Scripture contains diverse voices and perspectives (Ecclesiastes' pessimism under the sun vs. Revelation's eschatological hope). This diversity enriches understanding rather than undermining unity.
- **Contextual resolution:** Apparent contradictions resolve when passages are read in context. Ecclesiastes describes life "under the sun" (apart from God's redemptive work); Revelation announces God's new creation. Different contexts, not contradictory claims.
- **Progressive revelation:** God revealed truth over time. Earlier revelation may seem incomplete or contradicted by later revelation, but this reflects the unfolding of God's plan, not error.
- **Human limitations:** Some tensions may not resolve in our current understanding. This doesn't mean Scripture errs; it means our knowledge is partial (1 Cor 13:12).

## XI. The Formation and Recognition of Scripture

### Passages

**Exodus 24:4; 34:27-28** (ESV)
> And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD... And the LORD said to Moses, "Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.

**Jeremiah 30:2; 36:2** (ESV)
> Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you... Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.

**Habakkuk 2:2** (ESV)
> And the LORD answered me:
> "Write the vision;
> make it plain on tablets,
> so he may run who reads it."

**Revelation 1:11, 19** (ESV)
> saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches..."... Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this.

**1 Corinthians 14:37** (ESV)
> If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.

**2 Thessalonians 2:15** (ESV)
> So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.

**2 Thessalonians 3:14** (ESV)
> If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.

**1 Thessalonians 5:27** (ESV)
> I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.

**Colossians 4:16** (ESV)
> And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On the Divine Command to Write:**
- **Canonical consciousness:** Biblical authors were aware they were writing authoritative Scripture. God commanded them to write (Moses, Jeremiah, Habakkuk, John), showing divine intent for written revelation.
- **Preservation through writing:** Writing ensures the accurate transmission of God's revelation across generations, preventing distortion from oral tradition alone.

**On Apostolic Authority:**
- **Self-attestation:** Paul claims his letters carry the Lord's authority (1 Cor 14:37). This self-awareness supports the early recognition of apostolic writings as Scripture.
- **Circular reasoning concern:** If Paul claims authority, does that make his writings authoritative? Or does authority come from subsequent church recognition? The early church affirmed apostolic writings precisely because they recognized apostolic authority.

**On Oral and Written Tradition:**
- **Tradition alongside Scripture:** 2 Thessalonians 2:15 ("hold to the traditions...by our spoken word or by our letter") shows oral and written apostolic teaching both carried authority. This supports a role for church tradition.
- **Eventual inscripturation:** What was initially oral apostolic teaching was eventually written down in the NT. The "traditions" Paul refers to are now contained in Scripture.
- **Lost traditions?:** Did some authoritative apostolic teaching remain only oral and not get written? If so, where is it preserved—in church tradition or liturgy? Or was all necessary teaching inscripturated?

**On Canon Formation:**
- **Self-authenticating Scripture:** Apostolic letters circulated among churches (Col 4:16), were read publicly (1 Thess 5:27), and were recognized as Scripture (2 Pet 3:15-16). The canon emerged through the church's recognition of what God had inspired, not arbitrary selection.
- **Church authority over canon:** The church determined the canon at councils (Carthage, etc.). Scripture's authority depends on ecclesiastical authority.
- **Church recognizes, not creates:** The church recognized which books were inspired; it didn't create their authority. The canon closed when apostolic testimony ended.

## XII. The Holy Spirit and Scripture

### Passages

**2 Peter 1:21** (ESV)
> For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

**1 Corinthians 2:10-16** (ESV)
> these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. "For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.

**John 14:26** (ESV)
> But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

**John 16:13** (ESV)
> When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On the Spirit's Work in Inspiration:**
- **Organic inspiration:** The Spirit "carried along" human authors (2 Pet 1:21), working through their personalities, vocabularies, and situations while ensuring the result was God's word.
- **Dictation view (minority):** The Spirit dictated Scripture to passive human instruments. "Carried along" suggests complete divine control over the writing process.
- **Dual authorship:** Scripture has both divine and human authors. The Spirit inspired; humans wrote. Both dimensions are real and important.

**On the Spirit's Work in Illumination:**
- **Necessity of the Spirit for understanding:** "The natural person does not accept...they are spiritually discerned" (1 Cor 2:14) means unbelievers cannot truly understand Scripture without the Spirit's enlightening work. Regeneration is prerequisite for comprehension.
- **Spirit enables reception, not comprehension:** The unregenerate can intellectually understand Scripture but cannot accept or submit to it without the Spirit's work. The issue is volitional/spiritual, not cognitive.
- **Spirit and Scripture inseparable:** The same Spirit who inspired Scripture illuminates believers to understand it. Word and Spirit work together; neither functions properly without the other.

**On "Teach You All Things" and "Guide Into All Truth":**
- **Apostolic promise:** John 14:26 and 16:13 are addressed specifically to the apostles, enabling them to recall Jesus' teaching accurately (foundation for Gospel writing) and to receive further revelation (rest of NT). This promise doesn't extend to all believers in the same way.
- **Universal believer promise:** All believers receive the Spirit's teaching ministry. The Spirit guides every Christian into truth through Scripture. This is the priesthood of all believers.
- **Progressive understanding:** "Guide into all the truth" describes a process. The Spirit leads believers into deeper understanding over time, not instant comprehensive knowledge.
- **Completed in apostolic era:** The apostles were guided into "all the truth" necessary for the church, which was written down in the NT. The promise has been fulfilled; the canon is closed.

**On "Declare Things to Come":**
- **Predictive prophecy:** The Spirit revealed future events to the apostles (fulfilled in Revelation and eschatological passages).
- **Unveiling Christ's work:** "Things to come" refers to understanding the significance of Christ's death, resurrection, and ongoing work through the Spirit.
- **Ongoing prophetic gifts:** Some traditions see this as supporting continued prophetic revelation through the Spirit in the church, subordinate to Scripture.

## XIII. The Public Reading of Scripture

### Passages

**1 Timothy 4:13** (ESV)
> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.

**Nehemiah 8:1-3, 8** (ESV)
> And all the people gathered as one man into the square before the Water Gate. And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses that the LORD had commanded Israel. So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh month. And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law... They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.

**Revelation 1:3** (ESV)
> Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On the Practice of Public Reading:**
- **Central to worship:** Public Scripture reading was foundational in both synagogue and early church worship. It continues the practice of God's people gathered around God's word.
- **Liturgical function:** Scripture reading is a liturgical act, part of corporate worship. The public proclamation of God's word is itself an encounter with God.
- **Accessibility:** Public reading made Scripture accessible to illiterate believers and ensured all heard God's word, not just those who could read or afford manuscripts.

**On Explanation Accompanying Reading:**
- **Teaching essential:** Nehemiah 8:8 shows reading was accompanied by explanation ("gave the sense"). This supports the teaching office—Scripture is read and expounded.
- **Clarity doesn't eliminate need for preaching:** Though Scripture is clear, preaching helps believers understand and apply it. Explanation aids comprehension without implying Scripture is obscure.

**On the Blessing of Hearing and Keeping:**
- **Active response required:** Revelation 1:3 blesses not just readers and hearers, but "those who keep what is written." Hearing demands obedience.
- **Communal context:** The blessing assumes corporate worship where one reads and many hear—emphasizing the church as the context for Scripture.

## XIV. The Scope of What Was Written

### Passages

**John 20:30-31** (ESV)
> Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

**John 21:25** (ESV)
> Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I would suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.

**Acts 1:1-3** (ESV)
> In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

### Interpretive Perspectives

**On Selectivity:**
- **Divinely guided curation:** Scripture doesn't record everything Jesus said/did, but what is recorded was selected under divine inspiration to accomplish God's purpose (producing faith, John 20:31). Selectivity doesn't undermine sufficiency; it demonstrates intentionality.
- **Insufficiency concern:** If much wasn't written, can we be confident we have everything necessary? This raises questions about unrecorded teachings preserved in church tradition.
- **Purpose-driven writing:** John's explicit statement of purpose shows biblical authors were selective and intentional. They wrote to accomplish specific goals, not to provide exhaustive historical records.

**On Hyperbole (John 21:25):**
- **Emphasizes Jesus' greatness:** The hyperbole ("the world itself could not contain the books") magnifies Christ's incomparable person and work. The point is rhetorical, not literal.
- **Sufficiency and selectivity compatible:** What is written is sufficient, even though it's selective. We don't need exhaustive records, just faithful ones.

**On "All That Jesus Began":**
- **Continuation in Acts:** Luke's Gospel describes what Jesus "began" to do; Acts continues with what Jesus does through the apostles by the Spirit. This shows the NT as comprehensive apostolic testimony to Christ's ongoing work.
- **Foundation for church:** The apostolic witness ("many proofs," extensive teaching) provides sufficient foundation for the church's faith and mission.
