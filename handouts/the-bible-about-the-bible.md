# Everything the Bible Says About... The Bible

A comprehensive collection of biblical passages concerning Scripture itself, organized thematically with contextual notes and interpretive perspectives.

---

## I. The Origin and Authority of Scripture

### Divine Inspiration

**2 Timothy 3:14-17** (ESV)
> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. **All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.**

*Context:* Paul's final letter to Timothy, written shortly before his martyrdom, emphasizing the importance of Scripture in ministry.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- The phrase "breathed out by God" (Greek: *theopneustos*) is understood by some as plenary verbal inspiration—every word divinely given
- Others emphasize dynamic inspiration—God worked through human authors' personalities and contexts
- The scope of "all Scripture" is debated: Does this refer only to the Old Testament (what Timothy knew from childhood), or does it include New Testament writings?
- The practical focus ("profitable for...") is emphasized by some as the primary point, rather than making a systematic statement about inspiration

**2 Peter 1:19-21** (ESV)
> And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

*Context:* Peter defends the apostolic testimony against false teachers, grounding authority in eyewitness experience and prophetic Scripture.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Carried along" (Greek: *pheromenoi*) suggests to some a ship carried by wind—human agency cooperating with divine control
- The phrase "no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation" is variously understood as: (1) prophets didn't invent their messages, (2) readers shouldn't interpret privately, or (3) prophecy didn't originate in human minds
- Some see this as describing only Old Testament prophecy; others extend it to all biblical writing
- The relationship between human and divine authorship is described differently across traditions

### God's Word as Eternal and Unchanging

**Isaiah 40:6-8** (ESV)
> A voice says, "Cry!"
> And I said, "What shall I cry?"
> All flesh is grass,
> and all its beauty is like the flower of the field.
> The grass withers, the flower fades
> when the breath of the LORD blows on it;
> surely the people are grass.
> The grass withers, the flower fades,
> but the word of our God will stand forever.

*Context:* The beginning of Isaiah's "Book of Comfort" (chapters 40-66), contrasting human frailty with God's eternal purposes.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Some apply this to the written Scripture as eternally valid
- Others see "word of our God" as referring primarily to God's decree or promise (specifically the promise of restoration)
- The emphasis on endurance contrasts human weakness with divine reliability

**Psalm 119:89** (ESV)
> Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.

*Context:* Part of the longest chapter in the Bible, an acrostic poem celebrating God's law/word.

**Matthew 24:35** (ESV)
> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

*Context:* Jesus' Olivet Discourse on future events and the end times.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Some apply this to all of Jesus' teachings, emphasizing their eternal authority
- The immediate context concerns eschatological predictions, which some argue is the specific referent
- The statement's absoluteness ("heaven and earth will pass away") underscores the certainty of Christ's words

**1 Peter 1:23-25** (ESV)
> since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God; for
> "All flesh is like grass
> and all its glory like the flower of grass.
> The grass withers,
> and the flower falls,
> but the word of the Lord remains forever."
> And this word is the good news that was preached to you.

*Context:* Peter quotes Isaiah 40:6-8 and explicitly applies it to the gospel message.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Peter identifies "the word of the Lord" with "the good news that was preached"—some see this as the gospel message broadly, others as the specific apostolic preaching
- The imperishable nature of God's word is connected to spiritual rebirth

---

## II. The Sufficiency of Scripture

### Scripture as Complete and Adequate

**Deuteronomy 4:2** (ESV)
> You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.

*Context:* Moses' first discourse reviewing the Law before entering the Promised Land.

**Deuteronomy 12:32** (ESV)
> Everything that I command you, you shall be careful to do. You shall not add to it or take from it.

*Interpretive perspectives on Deuteronomy passages:*
- Some view these as protecting the Mosaic Law specifically, within its covenantal context
- Others see a principle applicable to all Scripture—God's revelation is not to be altered
- Questions arise: Do these commands prohibit further revelation, or only human tampering with existing revelation?
- The immediate context emphasizes obedience to specific commands, not necessarily canon formation

**Proverbs 30:5-6** (ESV)
> Every word of God proves true;
> he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
> Do not add to his words,
> lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.

*Context:* The words of Agur, a wisdom teacher, about human limitation and divine reliability.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- The warning against adding may address false prophecy or distorting God's revealed truth
- "Every word" emphasizes reliability and trustworthiness
- Some apply this as a canon principle; others see it as wisdom about not presuming to speak for God

**Revelation 22:18-19** (ESV)
> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.

*Context:* The closing verses of Revelation and the final words of the New Testament canon (as arranged).

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Does "this book" refer only to Revelation, or to the entire biblical canon?
- Some see this as John protecting his specific prophetic writing from alteration
- Others view it as a broader principle about Scripture, especially given its placement at the end of the Christian Bible
- The severity of the warning underscores the seriousness of tampering with God's revelation

**2 Timothy 3:16-17** (see above for full text)

*Interpretive perspectives on sufficiency:*
- "Complete, equipped for every good work" is seen by some as teaching Scripture's sufficiency for faith and practice
- Others note this addresses the minister's preparation, not necessarily excluding other sources of knowledge or church tradition
- The question of what "every good work" includes varies: salvation and sanctification only, or all areas of life?

### Warnings Against Going Beyond Scripture

**1 Corinthians 4:6** (ESV)
> I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.

*Context:* Paul addresses divisions in the Corinthian church based on allegiance to different teachers.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "What is written" may refer to specific Old Testament passages Paul has quoted, or to Scripture generally
- Some see this as a principle of *sola scriptura*; others view it as addressing the specific problem of factional pride in Corinth
- The phrase could also mean "not to think beyond what we have written [in this letter]"

**Galatians 1:8-9** (ESV)
> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed.

*Context:* Paul confronts the Galatian churches for turning to "a different gospel" that required circumcision.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- This protects the apostolic gospel from distortion, but does it establish Scripture as the *only* authority, or as the *final* authority?
- The standard is "the gospel...we preached"—oral apostolic teaching, later written down
- Some apply this broadly to all doctrine; others limit it to the specific gospel of justification by faith

## III. The Power and Effectiveness of God's Word

### The Word as Living and Active

**Hebrews 4:12-13** (ESV)
> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.

*Context:* Following a warning from Psalm 95 about unbelief, the author emphasizes that God's word searches the heart.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Is "the word of God" here the written Scripture, the spoken message, or Christ Himself (cf. John 1:1)?
- The transition to "his sight" in v. 13 suggests the focus may be on God's omniscient gaze, with "word" as the means of that penetrating judgment
- Most agree the functional point is clear: God's communication exposes human hearts

**Isaiah 55:10-11** (ESV)
> For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven
> and do not return there but water the earth,
> making it bring forth and sprout,
> giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
> so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;
> it shall not return to me empty,
> but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
> and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

*Context:* God's invitation to return to Him, emphasizing His thoughts and ways are higher than human ways.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "My word that goes out from my mouth" is seen by some as referring to prophetic proclamation, by others to Scripture broadly
- The certainty of God's word accomplishing His purpose is emphasized across interpretive traditions
- The agricultural metaphor suggests fruitfulness and life-giving power

**1 Thessalonians 2:13** (ESV)
> And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.

*Context:* Paul's thanksgiving for the Thessalonians' reception of the gospel.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "The word of God, which you heard from us" identifies apostolic preaching with God's word
- "At work in you" indicates the word's active, transforming power in believers
- Some distinguish between the message (content) and the text (Scripture), while others see them as unified

### Scripture as Spiritually Productive

**Romans 15:4** (ESV)
> For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

*Context:* Paul's discussion of strong and weak believers, grounding his teaching in Old Testament example.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Former days" clearly refers to the Old Testament
- The purpose is pastoral: instruction, endurance, encouragement, hope
- This assumes Scripture's relevance transcends its original historical context

**1 Corinthians 10:11** (ESV)
> Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.

*Context:* Paul recounts Israel's wilderness failures as warnings against idolatry and immorality.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Distinguishes between historical events ("happened to them") and recorded Scripture ("written down")
- "For our instruction" shows Scripture's didactic purpose across generations
- Some emphasize typological reading; others focus on moral example

**John 20:30-31** (ESV)
> Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

*Context:* John's statement of purpose for his Gospel, after recording Thomas's confession.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- John explicitly limits his account ("many other signs...not written"), showing selectivity in the biblical record
- The evangelistic purpose ("that you may believe") shapes what is included
- This raises questions about what else Jesus said/did that isn't recorded—is the written record sufficient even though incomplete?

**2 Timothy 3:15** (see section I for full passage)
> the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Able to make you wise for salvation" indicates Scripture's salvific purpose and power
- The instrumentality is "through faith in Christ Jesus"—Scripture points to Christ
- Some see this as teaching Scripture's clarity for salvation; others emphasize the need for faith and the Spirit's illumination

---

## IV. The Clarity and Understandability of Scripture

### Scripture as a Lamp and Light

**Psalm 119:105** (ESV)
> Your word is a lamp to my feet
> and a light to my path.

*Context:* The longest chapter of the Bible, an acrostic poem on the excellencies of God's law.

**Psalm 119:130** (ESV)
> The unfolding of your words gives light;
> it imparts understanding to the simple.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Unfolding" or "entrance" (translations vary) suggests either the act of opening/explaining Scripture or the word's inherent quality of enlightening
- "The simple" could mean the uneducated, the humble, or those without guile
- Some emphasize Scripture's self-evident clarity; others note the need for teaching and the Spirit's work

**Proverbs 6:23** (ESV)
> For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,
> and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life.

*Context:* Wisdom instruction about avoiding adultery, following parental teaching.

**2 Peter 1:19** (see section I for full passage)
> And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place...

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- The prophetic word (Scripture) functions as light in a dark world
- "Until the day dawns" suggests Scripture's role is provisional until Christ's return or until full understanding comes
- The exhortation to "pay attention" implies Scripture requires careful reading, not that it's obscure, but that it demands focus

### Examples of Scripture Being Searched and Understood

**Acts 17:11** (ESV)
> Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.

*Context:* Paul's ministry in Berea, where Jews tested his teaching against the Old Testament.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Commendation for testing teaching against Scripture implies Scripture is understandable and authoritative
- "Examining" suggests active, careful study—clarity doesn't mean superficial reading
- The Bereans didn't just accept apostolic authority but verified it biblically

**Nehemiah 8:8** (ESV)
> They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.

*Context:* Ezra and the Levites read the Law to the returned exiles after rebuilding Jerusalem's walls.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Gave the sense" suggests explanation or interpretation was necessary
- This could indicate: (1) translation from Hebrew to Aramaic, (2) explanation of meaning, or (3) both
- Does this support the need for teaching authority, or simply the value of good pedagogy?

**Luke 24:27, 32, 45** (ESV)
> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself... They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"... Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.

*Context:* The Emmaus road appearance and Jesus' post-resurrection teaching.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Jesus "interpreted" and "opened" the Scriptures—does this suggest Scripture requires authoritative interpretation to be understood?
- The disciples' hearts burned and their minds were opened—suggesting both intellectual and spiritual dimensions to understanding
- Some argue this shows Scripture's christocentric focus must be seen to be understood; others note this was pre-Pentecost, before the Spirit's full ministry

---

## V. The Preservation and Permanence of Scripture

### God's Commitment to His Word

**Matthew 5:18** (ESV)
> For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.

*Context:* The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus affirming He came to fulfill, not abolish, the Law and Prophets.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Not an iota, not a dot" (smallest Hebrew letter and stroke) emphasizes the Law's minutest details
- "Until all is accomplished" raises questions: Does this refer to Christ's work, the end of the age, or something else?
- Some see this as teaching preservation of the text; others emphasize the Law's enduring moral authority
- Does this apply to Old Testament law still, or was it all "accomplished" in Christ?

**Psalm 12:6-7** (ESV)
> The words of the LORD are pure words,
> like silver refined in a furnace on the ground,
> purified seven times.
> You, O LORD, will keep them;
> you will guard us from this generation forever.

*Context:* A lament about deceitful speech, contrasted with God's pure words.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "You will keep them" is sometimes translated "You will preserve them"—does "them" refer to God's words or to God's people?
- The Hebrew is debated: most modern translations favor preserving God's people, but traditional readings support preserving God's words
- The imagery of refined silver emphasizes purity and reliability

**Psalm 119:152** (ESV)
> Long have I known from your testimonies
> that you have founded them forever.

**Psalm 119:160** (ESV)
> The sum of your word is truth,
> and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.

---

## VI. The Nature and Character of Scripture

### Scripture as Truth

**John 17:17** (ESV)
> Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.

*Context:* Jesus' high priestly prayer for His disciples before the crucifixion.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Your word is truth" could refer to God's message/revelation broadly, or to Scripture specifically
- Some emphasize propositional truth (Scripture contains true statements); others emphasize relational truth (Scripture reveals the true God)
- The purpose is sanctification—truth has a purifying, transforming function

**Psalm 119:142** (ESV)
> Your righteousness is righteous forever,
> and your law is true.

**Psalm 119:151** (ESV)
> But you are near, O LORD,
> and all your commandments are true.

**Proverbs 30:5** (see section II for full text)
> Every word of God proves true;
> he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.

### Scripture as Perfect and Pure

**Psalm 19:7-11** (ESV)
> The law of the LORD is perfect,
> reviving the soul;
> the testimony of the LORD is sure,
> making wise the simple;
> the precepts of the LORD are right,
> rejoicing the heart;
> the commandment of the LORD is pure,
> enlightening the eyes;
> the fear of the LORD is clean,
> enduring forever;
> the rules of the LORD are true,
> and righteous altogether.
> More to be desired are they than gold,
> even much fine gold;
> sweeter also than honey
> and drippings of the honeycomb.
> Moreover, by them is your servant warned;
> in keeping them there is great reward.

*Context:* A psalm celebrating God's revelation in creation (vv. 1-6) and in Scripture (vv. 7-14).

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Six descriptions of God's word, each with a corresponding effect
- "Perfect" (Hebrew: *tamim*) means complete, whole, without defect
- The list emphasizes both the character of Scripture (perfect, sure, right, pure, clean, true) and its effects (reviving, making wise, rejoicing, enlightening)
- Some apply these attributes to all Scripture; others note the specific reference to "the law of the LORD" (Torah)

**Psalm 12:6** (see section V for full text)
> The words of the LORD are pure words,
> like silver refined in a furnace on the ground,
> purified seven times.

**2 Samuel 22:31** (ESV)
> This God—his way is perfect;
> the word of the LORD proves true;
> he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.

*Context:* David's song of deliverance, celebrating God's salvation from enemies.

---

## VII. Human Responsibility Toward Scripture

### Commands to Meditate and Observe

**Joshua 1:8** (ESV)
> This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.

*Context:* God's commissioning of Joshua to lead Israel into the Promised Land after Moses' death.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Meditate" (Hebrew: *hagah*) means to mutter, murmur, or speak quietly—suggesting verbal repetition and reflection
- The purpose is obedience ("do according to all that is written"), not merely knowledge
- Promise of prosperity and success is conditioned on obedience to the Law
- Does this apply to all Scripture, or specifically to Torah in its covenantal context?

**Psalm 1:1-3** (ESV)
> Blessed is the man
> who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
> nor stands in the way of sinners,
> nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
> but his delight is in the law of the LORD,
> and on his law he meditates day and night.
> He is like a tree
> planted by streams of water
> that yields its fruit in its season,
> and its leaf does not wither.
> In all that he does, he prospers.

*Context:* The introductory psalm, setting forth two ways—the way of the righteous and the way of the wicked.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Meditation on God's law is presented as the mark of the blessed person
- The imagery of the tree suggests stability, fruitfulness, and vitality
- "Day and night" echoes Joshua 1:8, emphasizing constant engagement with Scripture

**Deuteronomy 6:6-9** (ESV)
> And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

*Context:* The Shema (Deut 6:4-9), Israel's central confession of faith and command to love God.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- God's words are to permeate all of life: heart, home, conversation, daily routine
- Teaching the next generation is a central responsibility
- Physical reminders (hand, forehead, doorposts) underscore the importance of remembering God's commands
- Later Jewish practice took this literally (phylacteries, mezuzot); Jesus criticized external observance without internal reality (Matt 23:5)

**Deuteronomy 11:18-21** (ESV)
> You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.

*Context:* Moses' second discourse, emphasizing obedience as the condition for blessing in the land.

### Commands to Hear and Heed

**James 1:22-25** (ESV)
> But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

*Context:* James' practical instruction on living out Christian faith.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "The word" likely refers to the gospel message and/or Scripture broadly
- "The perfect law, the law of liberty" has been variously identified as: the Mosaic law properly understood, Jesus' teaching (especially the Sermon on the Mount), or Scripture as a whole
- The mirror analogy emphasizes self-examination leading to action
- Blessing comes from doing, not merely hearing

**Luke 11:28** (ESV)
> But he said, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!"

*Context:* Jesus' response when a woman in the crowd praised His mother.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Jesus redirects praise from biological relationship to spiritual obedience
- "The word of God" could mean Jesus' teaching specifically, or Scripture broadly
- Hearing and keeping are inseparable—true hearing results in obedience

**Matthew 4:4** (ESV)
> But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

*Context:* Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, quoting Deuteronomy 8:3.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Jesus uses Scripture to resist Satan, demonstrating its authority and sufficiency
- "Every word that comes from the mouth of God" emphasizes dependence on divine revelation for true life
- The original context in Deuteronomy referred to God's provision of manna; Jesus applies it more broadly

**Deuteronomy 8:3** (ESV)
> And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.

---

## VIII. The Scope and Purpose of Scripture

### All Scripture Points to Christ

**Luke 24:44-47** (ESV)
> Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled." Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem."

*Context:* Jesus' post-resurrection teaching to the disciples.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Jesus identifies the entire Old Testament (Law, Prophets, Psalms—the three divisions) as about Him
- "Opened their minds" suggests both the need for illumination and Christ's authority to interpret Scripture
- Does this mean every part of the OT is messianic/christological, or that the overall narrative points to Christ?
- Some see warrant here for typological and allegorical interpretation; others emphasize redemptive-historical reading

**John 5:39-40, 46-47** (ESV)
> You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life... For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?

*Context:* Jesus' confrontation with Jewish leaders who rejected His claims.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "You search the Scriptures" could be indicative (you do search) or imperative (search the Scriptures)
- The irony: they studied Scripture diligently but missed its central figure
- "Bear witness about me" indicates Scripture's christocentric purpose
- Jesus equates believing Moses' writings with believing Him—showing Scripture's authority points to His authority

### Scripture Written for Multiple Generations

**Romans 4:23-24** (ESV)
> But the words "it was counted to him" were not written for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord.

*Context:* Paul's argument that Abraham was justified by faith, not works, using Genesis 15:6.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Scripture's original historical context doesn't limit its application
- "For us also" shows Paul understands Scripture as written for subsequent generations of believers
- This supports typological and applicational reading beyond original historical reference

**1 Corinthians 9:9-10** (ESV)
> For it is written in the Law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plougher should plough in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.

*Context:* Paul's argument for financial support of ministers, using Deuteronomy 25:4.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Paul applies an agricultural law to gospel ministry support
- "Is it for oxen that God is concerned?" doesn't deny concern for animals, but asserts deeper purpose
- "Written for our sake" shows Scripture has broader application than original literal sense
- This passage is debated regarding hermeneutical method: Does Paul teach that the literal sense is secondary, or that it has additional application?

**John 14:21** (ESV)
> Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.

*Context:* Jesus' Upper Room discourse before His arrest.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "My commandments" refers to Jesus' teaching, showing His words carry divine authority
- Love and obedience are inseparably linked

### The Oracles of God

**Romans 3:1-2** (ESV)
> Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.

*Context:* Paul's argument that all humanity is under sin, addressing Jewish objections.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Oracles of God" likely refers to the Old Testament Scriptures entrusted to Israel
- The term emphasizes divine origin—these are God's spoken revelations

**Acts 7:38** (ESV)
> This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us.

*Context:* Stephen's speech recounting Israel's history before his martyrdom.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Living oracles" refers to the Law received at Sinai
- "Living" suggests ongoing vitality and relevance, not merely historical record

**Hebrews 5:12** (ESV)
> For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food.

*Context:* The author rebukes the readers for spiritual immaturity.

### The Scriptures (Graphe)

**John 10:35** (ESV)
> If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—

*Context:* Jesus' defense of His divine sonship claim, quoting Psalm 82:6.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Scripture cannot be broken" asserts Scripture's inviolability and authority
- Jesus uses this to establish a "how much more" argument from lesser to greater
- Some see this as teaching inerrancy; others emphasize reliability and authority

**2 Peter 3:15-16** (ESV)
> And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.

*Context:* Peter warns about false teachers who distort Paul's letters.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Peter classifies Paul's letters as "Scriptures," showing early recognition of apostolic writings as authoritative
- Acknowledgment that some things are "hard to understand" in Scripture
- The danger of twisting Scripture is emphasized—interpretation has consequences

## X. The Relationship Between Old and New Testaments

### The Law and the Prophets Fulfilled

**Matthew 5:17-18** (ESV)
> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.

*Context:* Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, establishing His relationship to the Old Testament.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Fulfill" is understood variously as: complete, bring to full meaning, embody, accomplish what it pointed to
- The question of how much of the Law remains binding for Christians is intensely debated
- "Until all is accomplished" is variously seen as: Christ's death/resurrection, the end of the age, or ongoing fulfillment
- Does "not pass from the Law" mean the Mosaic covenant continues, or that its purposes will be accomplished?

**Luke 16:16-17** (ESV)
> The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.

*Context:* Jesus' teaching on the Kingdom following the parable of the dishonest manager.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Were until John" suggests a shift in redemptive history, but v. 17 affirms the Law's enduring validity
- How to reconcile these? Some see discontinuity (new covenant replaces old); others see continuity (moral law endures)

**Romans 10:4** (ESV)
> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.

*Context:* Paul's explanation of Israel's unbelief and the gospel's availability to all.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "End" (Greek: *telos*) could mean termination, goal, or fulfillment
- Does this mean the Law is terminated as a means of righteousness, or that Christ is the Law's intended goal?
- Most agree Paul is addressing justification specifically, not necessarily all uses of the Law

### The New Covenant and Scripture

**Jeremiah 31:31-34** (ESV)
> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

*Context:* Jeremiah's prophecy of restoration, promising a new covenant superior to the Mosaic covenant.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Quoted in Hebrews 8:8-12 as fulfilled in Christ
- "I will put my law within them" shows continuity (God's law) and discontinuity (internal vs. external)
- "No longer shall each one teach" raises questions about the need for teachers under the new covenant
- Does this diminish the role of written Scripture, or does it describe the Spirit's internal witness to Scripture?

**2 Corinthians 3:4-18** (ESV)
[This is a lengthy passage contrasting the old and new covenants; key excerpts:]
> ...our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life... Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory... will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?... Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it... But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away... And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.

*Context:* Paul defends his apostolic ministry against those who demanded letters of recommendation.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Not of the letter but of the Spirit" is debated: Does "letter" mean legalism, or the written code itself?
- "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" is applied various ways: Law vs. Gospel, external vs. internal, or literalism vs. spiritual understanding
- The veil imagery (from Exodus 34) is applied to unbelieving Israel's inability to see Christ in the OT
- Does this diminish the old covenant/OT, or exalt the new covenant's glory by comparison?

## XI. Challenges and Difficulties

### Acknowledgment of Hard Passages

**2 Peter 3:16** (see section IX for full text)
> There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Scripture itself acknowledges that parts are difficult to understand
- The warning is against twisting (Greek: *streblousin*—to torture, distort) difficult passages
- This suggests humility and care are needed in interpretation

### Diversity Within Scripture

**Ecclesiastes 1:2, 9** (ESV)
> Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,
> vanity of vanities! All is vanity...
> What has been is what will be,
> and what has been done is what will be done,
> and there is nothing new under the sun.

*Context:* The opening of Ecclesiastes, expressing life's futility "under the sun" (apart from God).

*Compared with:*

**Revelation 21:5** (ESV)
> And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." Also he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."

*Context:* The vision of the new heaven and new earth.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Scripture contains diverse perspectives and genres—wisdom literature's existential questioning alongside apocalyptic hope
- Some emphasize Scripture's unity despite surface tensions; others note the importance of hearing each voice on its own terms
- Does "nothing new under the sun" contradict "I am making all things new"? Or does the former describe life apart from God's redemptive work, while the latter announces His eschatological renewal?

## XII. The Formation and Recognition of Scripture

### The Writing of Scripture

**Exodus 24:4** (ESV)
> And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

*Context:* The covenant ceremony at Sinai.

**Exodus 34:27-28** (ESV)
> And the LORD said to Moses, "Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.

**Jeremiah 30:2** (ESV)
> Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.

**Jeremiah 36:2** (ESV)
> Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.

*Context:* God commands Jeremiah to write his prophecies, which King Jehoiakim later burns (vv. 20-26), prompting God to command a second scroll with additions (v. 32).

**Habakkuk 2:2** (ESV)
> And the LORD answered me:
> "Write the vision;
> make it plain on tablets,
> so he may run who reads it."

**Revelation 1:11, 19** (ESV)
> saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches..."... Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this.

*Context:* John's commission to write the Apocalypse.

### Apostolic Authority

**1 Corinthians 14:37** (ESV)
> If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.

*Context:* Paul's instructions on orderly worship in Corinth.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Paul claims his written instructions carry the Lord's authority
- This self-awareness of writing authoritatively is seen as evidence of emerging canonical consciousness
- Does this apply to all of Paul's letters, or only specific commands in this letter?

**2 Thessalonians 2:15** (ESV)
> So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.

*Context:* Paul addresses false teaching about the Day of the Lord.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Both oral and written apostolic teaching carry authority
- "Traditions" (Greek: *paradoseis*) means what is handed down
- Does this support the authority of church tradition alongside Scripture, or simply acknowledge that apostolic teaching was initially oral before being written?

**2 Thessalonians 3:14** (ESV)
> If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.

*Context:* Instructions regarding the disorderly/idle.

**1 Thessalonians 5:27** (ESV)
> I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.

*Context:* Paul's closing instructions.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- The solemnity of the oath suggests Paul's letters were to be treated as authoritative documents for the whole church
- Public reading in the assembly parallels the synagogue practice of reading the Law and Prophets

### The Canon and Apostolic Writings

**2 Peter 3:15-16** (see section IX for full text—Peter recognizes Paul's letters as Scripture)

**Colossians 4:16** (ESV)
> And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.

*Context:* Paul's closing greetings and instructions.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Exchange of letters between churches suggests early circulation and collection of apostolic writings
- Public reading in worship implies authoritative status

## XIII. The Role of the Holy Spirit in Scripture

### The Spirit's Work in Inspiration

**2 Peter 1:21** (see section I for full text)
> For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

### The Spirit's Work in Illumination

**1 Corinthians 2:10-16** (ESV)
> these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.

> The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. "For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.

*Context:* Paul contrasts worldly and spiritual wisdom, defending apostolic ministry.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "The Spirit who is from God, that we might understand" shows the Spirit's role in understanding revelation
- "The natural person does not accept...they are spiritually discerned" indicates human inability apart from the Spirit
- Does this mean Scripture cannot be understood without the Spirit's illumination, or that it cannot be accepted/received without the Spirit?
- The transition from apostolic revelation (v. 13) to believer's understanding (v. 14) raises questions about ongoing revelation vs. illumination

**John 14:26** (ESV)
> But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

*Context:* Jesus' Upper Room discourse, promising the Spirit to the apostles.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Bring to your remembrance" is seen by some as foundational for the writing of the Gospels
- "Teach you all things" could mean: (1) all things necessary for salvation, (2) all of Jesus' teaching, (3) progressive revelation, or (4) ongoing guidance
- Does this promise apply uniquely to the apostles, or to all believers?

**John 16:13** (ESV)
> When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.

*Context:* Continued promise of the Spirit in the Upper Room discourse.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Guide you into all the truth" is variously understood as: completed in the apostolic era, ongoing in the church, or fulfilled in each believer's understanding
- "Declare to you the things that are to come" could refer to predictive prophecy or to the unveiling of Christ's work

---

## XIV. The Public Reading of Scripture

### Corporate Reading Commanded

**1 Timothy 4:13** (ESV)
> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.

*Context:* Paul's instruction to Timothy regarding pastoral ministry.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Public reading of Scripture" shows early Christian practice inherited from synagogue worship
- The triad—reading, exhortation, teaching—suggests Scripture is foundational to preaching and instruction
- "Scripture" here likely means the Old Testament, though apostolic letters were also read publicly (see below)

**Nehemiah 8:1-3, 8** (ESV)
> And all the people gathered as one man into the square before the Water Gate. And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses that the LORD had commanded Israel. So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh month. And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law... They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.

*Context:* The restoration community under Ezra and Nehemiah, rediscovering the Law.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Public reading was comprehensive ("from early morning until midday")
- Explanation accompanied reading ("gave the sense")
- The people's response was emotional and worshipful (vv. 9-12)

**Revelation 1:3** (ESV)
> Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near.

*Context:* Opening beatitude of Revelation.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "Reads aloud" indicates public reading in the assembly
- The blessing extends to readers, hearers, and keepers—emphasizing obedience
- This suggests Revelation was intended as a liturgical document

---

## XV. Final Observations

### The Scope of What Was Written

**John 21:25** (ESV)
> Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I would suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.

*Context:* The closing verse of John's Gospel.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- Scripture is selective, not exhaustive
- The hyperbole emphasizes Jesus' incomparable greatness
- This raises questions about the relationship between what Jesus said/did and what is recorded
- Does the selectivity undermine sufficiency, or does it show intentional divine curation?

**Acts 1:1-3** (ESV)
> In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

*Context:* Opening of Acts, referring back to Luke's Gospel.

*Interpretive perspectives:*
- "All that Jesus began to do and teach" suggests the Gospel is a beginning, with Acts continuing the account of Jesus' work through the apostles
- The phrase "many proofs" and extended resurrection appearances show evidential foundation for the written record
