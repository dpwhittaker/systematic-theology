# Jesus: What Does It Mean to Be the Son of God?
## The Arian View — A Contribution by Arius of Alexandria (c. 256–336 AD)

*Part of a collaborative handout series. Other contributors represent the Trinitarian, Jewish, and Spirit Christology perspectives. Each contributor presents their actual historical or theological position with full biblical evidence. Readers are encouraged to weigh the arguments for themselves.*

*Arius was a presbyter in Alexandria who taught that the Son of God is the first and greatest of all God's works — divine and incomparable, but not co-eternal or co-equal with the Father. His teaching provoked the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), which condemned it. He writes here as a man who believed he was defending Scripture and true monotheism. He lost the institutional debate. He still believed he was right.*

## 1. GUARDRAILS — The Outer Limits I Affirm Without Reservation

I have been called a heretic. My opponents have said I make Jesus into a mere creature, a demigod, something less than God. I want to begin by stating plainly what I believe — not to win sympathy, but because intellectual honesty demands it. I am a Christian. I have always been a Christian.

**Jesus is the Son of God — uniquely, supremely, incomparably.**
He is not a prophet, not a teacher who was elevated by legend, not an angel. He is the eternal Son, brought forth by the Father before all creation, before time had any meaning. The distance between the Son and every other created being is as vast as the distance between the Father and the Son. There is no one like Him in heaven or on earth.

**Jesus is the Messiah of Israel.**
He is the one promised to Abraham, Moses, and David. Every covenant of God finds its fulfillment in Him. He is the Anointed King whose kingdom will never end.

**Jesus bodily rose from the dead.**
The tomb was empty. He appeared in a body of flesh and bone. He ate with His disciples. He showed them His wounds. The resurrection is not a symbol. It is a fact of history, and it is the guarantee of our resurrection. I confess this without qualification.

**Jesus is Lord — given all authority by the Father.**
At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue confess. He is seated at the right hand of the Father. Every dominion, every power, every ruler is subject to Him. To call Him "Lord" is to give Him the most exalted title a creature can receive — and it is a title the Father Himself has conferred on Him.

**Jesus is the agent of all creation.**
*"All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made"* (John 1:3). When God created the universe, He did so through the Son. The entire creation bears the mark of the Son's wisdom and the Father's will working through Him.

**Salvation comes through Jesus alone.**
*"There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved"* (Acts 4:12). The Son purchased our redemption through His blood. Through faith in Him alone a person is reconciled to the Father.

**There is only ONE unbegotten God — the Father.**
This is the cornerstone of everything I believe. The Father alone is uncaused, unbegun, unbegotten. He alone has always existed from Himself, owing His existence to nothing and no one. Everything else — everything — derives from Him. The Son Himself owes His existence to the Father's will. This is not a diminishment of the Son; it is the glory of the Father. But it means the Son is *from* the Father — and therefore not the Father's co-equal.

## 2. MY VIEW: What Does "Son of God" Mean?

My opponents accuse me of making the Son a mere man, a creature on the same level as the angels or the prophets. I have never taught this. The Son is incomparably greater than every angel, every prophet, every being God has ever created. But He is *from* the Father — not co-eternal *with* the Father. And this distinction matters enormously, because Scripture itself insists on it.

### The Son Is the Firstborn of All Creation

The great Wisdom text of Proverbs speaks in a voice the church has always recognized as the pre-existent Son — the divine Wisdom through whom God made all things:

> The LORD *possessed* me at the beginning of His work, the first of His acts of old. Ages ago I was *set up*, at the first, before the beginning of the earth. When there were no depths I was *brought forth*, when there were no springs abounding with water. Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was *brought forth*. (Proverbs 8:22–25, ESV)

"The LORD *possessed* me" — the Hebrew verb is *qanah*, to acquire, to bring into being, to make one's own. "Before the beginning of the earth" — there was a beginning to the Son's existence, prior to creation but subsequent to the Father. "I was *brought forth*" — not "I always was," but *brought forth*, with a clear implication of origin. This is not the language of co-eternity. This is the language of procession, of beginning, of derivation. The Son had a beginning. The Father did not.

Paul confirms this in Colossians:

> He is the image of the invisible God, the *firstborn over all creation*. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth. (Colossians 1:15–16, NKJV)

"Firstborn over all creation." My opponents argue that *prototokos* here means preeminent in rank, not first in time. But this is special pleading. Every Jewish and Greek reader knew what *prototokos* meant: the one who came first, the eldest. The firstborn *over* creation is the firstborn *of* creation — supreme over all the rest, but numbered among it. Paul's own explanation confirms this: "For by Him all things were created" — not *he himself is uncreated alongside all the rest*, but that all *other* things were made through Him.

The Revelation of John makes it explicit:

> These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the *beginning of God's creation*. (Revelation 3:14, NIV)

"The *beginning* of God's creation." My opponents say this means He is the *originating source* of creation, not its first item. But if the Son is the originating source and yet not Himself part of creation, it is strange to call Him "of God's creation" at all. The natural reading is that He is creation's first, its origin, the firstborn through whom all else came into being.

### The Father Is Greater — in Nature, Not Just in Role

Jesus said it plainly, without qualification:

> My Father is *greater than I*. (John 14:28, NKJV)

My opponents insist this applies only to the Son's incarnate, human condition — that as a man He submitted to the Father, but in His divine nature He is fully equal. But notice the context. Jesus is comforting His disciples by promising they should be *glad* He is going to the Father, *because the Father is greater*. This is comfort: He goes to the greater one. If the Son and the Father were co-equal in divine essence, this argument makes no sense. The Son goes to the greater; therefore rejoice.

The question of knowledge cuts even deeper:

> But about that day or hour *no one knows*, not even the angels in heaven, *nor the Son*, but only the Father. (Mark 13:32, NIV)

If the Son is *homoousios* — of the same substance as the Father — how can He not know what the Father knows? Substance cannot be divided. If they share a single divine nature, the Son must know everything the Father knows. But Jesus says He does not know the day or hour. My opponents tie themselves in knots explaining this verse. I read it plainly: the Father has knowledge the Son does not. The Father is greater — not just in role, but in what He possesses.

Jesus defined eternal life with illuminating precision:

> And this is eternal life, that they know You, *the only true God*, and Jesus Christ *whom You have sent*. (John 17:3, ESV)

Two distinct subjects. The Father is "the only true God." Jesus is the one "sent" by that God. If Jesus were co-equally God with the Father, why would He call the Father "the only true God" without including Himself in that title? The language is careful and deliberate: the title "only true God" belongs to the Father in a way it does not belong to the Son.

Paul preserves the same distinction:

> Yet for us there is *one God, the Father*, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and *one Lord, Jesus Christ*, through whom are all things and through whom we exist. (1 Corinthians 8:6, ESV)

One God — the Father. One Lord — Jesus Christ. These are different titles. God is the source and goal of all things. The Lord is the agent through whom God acts. Paul is carefully maintaining monotheism while giving the Son the highest possible second rank. If the Son were co-equally God with the Father, Paul would have said: "one God, the Father and the Son." He did not.

When addressed as "Good Teacher," Jesus deflected the honor:

> Why do you call Me good? *No one is good but One, that is, God.* (Mark 10:18, NKJV)

If Jesus is fully and equally God in the same sense as the Father, why redirect the attribution of absolute goodness? He could have said: "Yes, I am good — I am God." He did not. He pointed upward, as He always does, to the Father who alone holds that absolute title.

After the resurrection, to Mary Magdalene:

> I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to *My God* and your God. (John 20:17, NKJV)

"My God." The risen, glorified Son — *after* the resurrection, not before, not during the humiliation of the incarnation — calls the Father *His God*. You do not call your equal "my God." The Father is the Son's God. That is the permanent, eternal relationship. It was not ended by the resurrection. It will not end in eternity.

### The Son Was Begotten — and Begetting Implies a Beginning

Words mean things. "Son" means something. "Begotten" means something. A son is not co-eternal with his father. The relationship of Father to Son logically requires priority — the father exists before the son, at least in the order of origination. The Nicene Creed itself says the Son is "eternally begotten." But I ask: what is *eternal* begetting? What is a *timeless* generation? These phrases cancel each other out. Either the Son was begotten — which implies a beginning, a prior moment when the Father alone existed — or He was not begotten, in which case the word means nothing.

Acts records what Peter preached at Pentecost:

> Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has *made* this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah. (Acts 2:36, NIV)

"God has *made*" — the Greek is *epoiesen*, He made, He appointed, He brought about. My opponents say this applies only to the resurrection-appointment of the human Jesus to Lordship. But they must then explain how the pre-incarnate Son was always and eternally Lord if this act of making was necessary for His Lordship. The text suggests becoming — which is exactly what I have argued.

The letter to the Hebrews is explicit:

> Having *become* so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. (Hebrews 1:4, NKJV)

"Having *become*." Not "having always been." There is movement implied, a transformation, a process of coming to possess what He now holds. He obtained by inheritance. Inheritance comes after a bequest. If the Son eternally and equally possessed everything the Father possesses, the language of "having become" and "having obtained" is without meaning.

### Against the Nicene Formula

What happened at Nicaea requires a direct response. My opponents insisted on the word *homoousios* — "of the same substance" as the Father. They forced this into the creed. But *homoousios* is not a word found anywhere in Scripture. Not once. It is a Greek philosophical term. And more than that: the councils that preceded Nicaea had actually *condemned* this word as dangerous — because it was used by Paul of Samosata to argue for a kind of modalism, a collapsing of Father and Son into a single being. My opponents brought back the same condemned word to defeat me, even though it had previously been judged suspect.

If I am accused of letting Greek philosophy contaminate Scripture, I return the charge. *Homoousios* is as Greek as anything Plato ever wrote. It solves one problem — preserving the Son's full divinity — by creating another: if Father and Son are of the same substance, what distinguishes them? If they fully and equally share a single divine substance, you have — despite all protests — either two gods, or one god in two modes (which is modalism, the very heresy the councils were trying to defeat). The Nicene position asserts "same substance" and "distinct persons" and then declares the resulting tension a mystery. I am told to accept the mystery. But the mystery was manufactured by importing a foreign philosophical category that Scripture never uses.

Scripture gives us a simpler, cleaner answer: the Father is the one God, the Son is the unique divine firstborn through whom God made all things and redeems the world. The Son is exalted above every name. He is worthy of all honor and worship. But He is the Father's Son — not His equal.

## 3. HONEST TENSIONS — What I Have to Reckon With

I said I would be honest. My opponents have strong texts too. Here is how I understand them — not to dismiss them, but to read them faithfully.

**John 1:1 — "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."**

This is the hardest verse for my position, and I will not pretend otherwise. But I read it carefully. The Word was *with* God — which establishes distinction, not identity. Two parties in relationship. And "the Word was God" — the Greek here uses the anarthrous *theos*, God without the definite article, which in Greek often signals a qualitative or categorical use rather than absolute identity. John is saying the Word was *divine* in nature, *of God's kind*, *of the divine character* — not that the Word is the same being as the Father. If John had meant absolute identity, he would have used the same grammatical construction both times. He did not.

I acknowledge this reading is disputed. I hold it with conviction but without insisting it is the only possible one.

**John 8:58 — "Before Abraham was, I AM."**

This is powerful. Jesus uses the language of Exodus 3:14, the divine name. He is claiming a pre-existence that transcends all human chronology. I agree entirely — the Son existed before Abraham, before the creation of the physical world, before the foundation of the earth. "I AM" in this context means: I am the one who has always been, from before all ages, the divine Son through whom God created and acts. Pre-existence is not in dispute. What I dispute is whether that pre-existence is uncaused and unbegotten. The Son can say "I AM" truthfully because He has existed from before all created things — not because He is co-equal and co-eternal with the Father.

**John 20:28 — Thomas: "My Lord and my God!"**

Thomas's confession is genuine worship, and I honor it as such. The risen Christ is rightly called "God" — He bears the divine nature, He is God's perfect image, He is the one through whom God acts in the world. The title "God" given to the Son is the highest possible honor. But a title given is not an essence co-possessed. Throughout the Old Testament, beings called *elohim* — divine agents, God's representatives — receive exalted designations without being co-equal with the Father. When Thomas says "my God," he is using the language of supreme devotion, not making a metaphysical claim about identical substance.

**Hebrews 1:8 — "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever."**

The Father addresses the Son as "God" — I know this text. It confirms that the Son possesses genuine, real divinity and deserves the highest possible title. His throne is eternal. His kingship is everlasting. But notice: it is the Father *addressing* the Son, the Father *conferring* this title. One who gives and one who receives. A title conferred by the Father upon the Son implies the Father's priority — not their ontological equality.

**The Problem of Worship**

My opponents press me hardest here: "Arius, if the Son is a creature, how can we worship Him? Is that not idolatry — giving to a created being the honor that belongs only to God?"

This is a serious challenge. My answer is this: the Father Himself has commanded the worship of the Son. *"Let all God's angels worship Him"* (Hebrews 1:6). *"That all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father"* (John 5:23). I do not worship the Son on my own initiative or by my own theological innovation. I worship Him because the Father has decreed it. This is not idolatry; it is obedience. The Father, in His sovereignty, has appointed the Son to a place where honoring the Son is inseparable from honoring the Father.

I admit this is the most difficult element of my theology to defend. If the Son is a creature, there is a real philosophical question about what category of honor is appropriate. My answer is simply: the Father has resolved that question by His own sovereign decree. We worship the Son because God commanded it, and that is sufficient.

## 4. APPLICATIONS — What All Christians Share

Whatever the Council of Nicaea decided about me, whatever the church has declared since — I was never arguing for a lesser Jesus. I was arguing for a Father whose supremacy is so absolute that even His own Son exists by His will. Whether that theology is right or wrong, it came from love of God and love of Christ. And in what matters for daily Christian life, I stand fully with every believer who calls on Jesus's name.

**We all kneel before the same Lord.**
When the church gathers, Nicene and Arian alike bow before the risen Jesus. We confess Him as Lord. We receive His body and blood. We sing His praises. The devotion of Christian worship is exactly the same. The controversy is about how to describe the metaphysics of His relationship with the Father — not about whether He is Lord.

**We all proclaim the same gospel.**
The Son of God entered human history as a man. He lived without sin. He died on the cross for the sins of the world. He rose from the dead on the third day. He ascended to the Father's right hand. He will return to judge the living and the dead. This gospel, which is the only gospel, every Christian holds.

**We all read the same Scripture.**
My argument with the Nicenes is, at bottom, about who reads Scripture more faithfully. We share the same canon, the same text, the same conviction that the Bible is God's Word and that it speaks truthfully about who Jesus is. We disagree about what it says on this particular question. That is a real and important disagreement. But it happens within a shared commitment to biblical authority.

**We all pray to the same Father.**
Jesus taught us: "Our Father in heaven." He taught us that the Father loves us, hears us, cares for us. Every Christian — whatever their position on the Son's metaphysical status — goes to the Father through the Son. That relational reality is not touched by theological controversy.

**We all love the same Jesus.**
I have loved Jesus Christ from the day I first believed. The energy I brought to this debate was not the energy of diminishment. It was the energy of a man who thought that protecting true monotheism — the absolute supremacy of the Father — was how you honoured the Son properly. I may be wrong. I believed then, and I believe now, that I was right. But the love was genuine. And I believe it is the same love every Christian has for the Son who died for us all.

---

*A final word from Arius:*

*The Council of Nicaea made its decision in 325 AD, and that decision has shaped Christian orthodoxy for seventeen centuries. I stand in the minority — declared, in fact, to stand outside it. But I was not arguing for a lesser Jesus. I was arguing for a God whose supremacy is so absolute that even His own Son exists only by His will and gift. The distance between the Father and the Son, in my view, does not diminish the Son. It magnifies the Father. And the Father who is magnified above all things is the one who so loved the world that He sent this unique, incomparable, divine Son to die for it.*

*That is the God I worship. That is the Son I confess.*

*Whether Nicaea's formula or mine more faithfully preserves that truth — that is the question I leave to you.*
