# Homosexuality and Scripture: The Primary Texts

The following passages are most frequently cited in the contemporary Christian debate on same-sex relationships. For each text, arguments from both traditional and affirming interpretive positions are listed. No conclusions are drawn.

# Genesis 1–2 (Creation Narratives)

> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. (**Genesis 1:27**, ESV)

> Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. (**Genesis 2:24**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The male-female binary is established at creation as the norm, not as a cultural arrangement
- "One flesh" union presupposes sexual complementarity between husband and wife
- Jesus himself cites Genesis 2:24 as the definition of marriage (Matt 19:4–5; Mark 10:6–9)
- Every positive biblical depiction of marriage reflects this male-female pattern
- The creation of woman from man's rib (Gen 2:21–23) emphasizes the complementarity of the sexes

**Affirming arguments:**
- The text describes what marriage is, not what it categorically cannot be
- Silence regarding same-sex relationships is not equivalent to prohibition
- Jesus cites Genesis 2:24 in the context of a divorce question, not a homosexuality question
- The passage does not address people with a same-sex orientation, which is a modern anthropological category
- Many other aspects of the creation narrative are not treated as permanent norms (e.g., single garden location, no clothing)
- The male-female pairing in 1:27–28 is explicitly tied to the command to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth"; that command has been fulfilled by humanity collectively and is no longer the governing rationale for sexual ethics

# Genesis 19 (Sodom and Gomorrah)

> And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them." (**Genesis 19:5**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The men of Sodom demand sexual access to Lot's guests; the intent is understood as same-sex assault
- God's judgment on the city follows immediately after this attempted violation
- New Testament writers connect Sodom's sin to sexual immorality (Jude 7; 2 Peter 2:6–7)
- The Hebrew *yada* ("know") in this context is almost certainly sexual, matching its use in Genesis 4:1, 4:17, etc.

**Affirming arguments:**
- The sin is gang rape and violent violation of hospitality, not consensual same-sex relationships
- Ezekiel 16:49 identifies Sodom's primary sin as pride, gluttony, and neglect of the poor—no mention of homosexuality
- The story addresses power, violence, and hospitality violation; it has no bearing on committed same-sex relationships
- Ancient Near Eastern hospitality laws made violation of guests an especially grave social offense—the text condemns that violation, not the gender of the victims
- Genesis 19:4 says *kol-ha'am* ("all the people of Sodom")—ESV adds "to the last man" but that phrase is not in the Hebrew; the crowd is the entire populace, not a group of men
- Genesis 19:1 identifies the visitors as *malachim* (angels), not men, and Lot bowed down (*vayishtachu*) before them—the crowd may have recognized them as supernatural beings
- This mirrors Genesis 6:1–4, where "sons of God" (angels) came to human women and the resulting corruption brought the Flood; Sodom's attempted violation of angels echoes that same human-divine boundary transgression, explaining God's targeted destruction of this specific city

# Jude 6–7

> ...just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire [*hetera sarx*], serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. (**Jude 7**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- "Unnatural desire" (*hetera sarx*, "other/strange flesh") refers to men seeking sex with men, which Jude condemns as paradigmatic of divine judgment
- The parallel with the angels (v. 6) who transgressed their created station amplifies the boundary-crossing theme
- Jude treats sexual sin as a component of Sodom's guilt alongside the Genesis account

**Affirming arguments:**
- *Hetera sarx* ("other flesh") more likely refers to the men of Sodom attempting sex with angels—beings of a literally different kind of flesh—not same-sex relations between humans
- If the condemnation is about species-crossing (human-angel), it does not speak to consensual same-sex human relationships
- The precise referent of *hetera sarx* is debated among scholars; certainty in either direction is overstated

# Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13

> You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (**Leviticus 18:22**, ESV)

> If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (**Leviticus 20:13**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The prohibition is explicit and unambiguous in its plain reading
- The Holiness Code (Lev 17–26) is widely held to contain moral, not merely ceremonial, law
- *Toevah* ("abomination") is also used for ethical violations such as deceptive scales and child sacrifice—not only ritual distinctions
- Capital punishment signals moral gravity, not merely a purity regulation
- The New Testament does not explicitly repeal or limit this prohibition

**Affirming arguments:**
- The same Holiness Code prohibits mixing fabrics, eating shellfish, and planting mixed crops—virtually all Christians treat these as not binding on Gentile believers
- *Toevah* frequently marks cultural or cultic distinctives (idolatry, pagan practices), suggesting context-specific, not universal, application
- The prohibition may specifically target cultic same-sex acts associated with Canaanite or Egyptian religious practices in view
- Paul's letters, not Leviticus, form the New Testament framework for Gentile sexual ethics

# Romans 1:18–32

> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. (**Romans 1:26–27**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The most explicit New Testament statement on same-sex behavior, covering both women and men
- Paul frames same-sex relations as an "exchange"—a departure from God's created design
- "Against nature" (*para physin*) echoes the Genesis 1–2 creation order argument
- The condemnation appears within Paul's broader argument about universal human moral failure under God's judgment
- The context links sexual ethics to theological ethics: idolatry inverts the created order, including the sexual order

**Affirming arguments:**
- *Para physin* ("against nature") may reflect Paul's Stoic cultural assumptions; the same phrase appears regarding men wearing long hair (1 Cor 11:14), which most do not treat as a universal moral prohibition
- The text may address heterosexual persons acting against *their own* nature, not persons with a same-sex orientation acting consistently with theirs
- Paul may be targeting the exploitative Greco-Roman same-sex practices of his context (pederasty, prostitution, master-slave sex) rather than committed relationships
- The referent of the women's "unnatural relations" (v. 26) is unspecified; some argue it refers to non-procreative heterosexual practices
- The rhetorical aim of Romans 1 is to indict all self-righteous moral judgment (cf. 2:1 "you have no excuse"); the chapter is an argument leading to that conclusion, not a standalone sexual ethics statement

# 1 Corinthians 6:9 — *Malakoi* and *Arsenokoitai*

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor *malakoi*, nor *arsenokoitai*... (**1 Corinthians 6:9**, ESV)

*Note: Many English Bibles render these two words together as "men who practice homosexuality" (ESV) or "homosexual offenders" (NIV). They are distinct Greek terms:*

**Traditional arguments:**
- *Arsenokoitai* is a compound of *arsēn* (male) + *koitē* (bed), directly echoing the Greek Septuagint rendering of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13—Paul likely coined it from those texts
- *Malakoi* ("soft ones") was commonly used in Greco-Roman contexts for the passive partner in male same-sex intercourse
- Together the two words may address both active and passive roles, constituting a comprehensive prohibition
- The terms represent a consistent Pauline ethic continuous with the Levitical prohibitions

**Affirming arguments:**
- *Arsenokoitai* is rare in Greek literature; earlier uses outside Paul link it to economic exploitation or coercive sex acts, not consensual relationships
- *Malakoi* more broadly denotes "morally weak," "effeminate," or "lacking self-discipline"—not necessarily sexual behavior at all
- No first-century secular text clearly uses either term to describe mutual, consensual same-sex relationships
- Modern translation choices ("homosexuals," "men who have sex with men") import 20th–21st century categories into ancient terminology

# 1 Timothy 1:8–10

> ...the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners... the sexually immoral, *arsenokoitai*, enslavers, liars, perjurers... (**1 Timothy 1:9–10**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- Consistent use with 1 Corinthians 6:9 confirms *arsenokoitai* is part of Paul's settled ethical vocabulary
- The vice list echoes the structure of the Ten Commandments, placing *arsenokoitai* within core moral law
- Pairing with "enslavers" (*andrapodistais*) may add a coercive dimension but does not eliminate the sexual referent

**Affirming arguments:**
- The same lexical uncertainty from 1 Corinthians 6:9 applies here
- Proximity to "enslavers" suggests the word may primarily target commercial sexual exploitation (slave prostitution, pederasty) rather than consensual same-sex relations
- No independent first-century definition of *arsenokoitai* conclusively covers consensual adult same-sex activity

# Additional Passages Sometimes Cited

## Ezekiel 16:49–50

> Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it. (**Ezekiel 16:49–50**, ESV)

- **Traditional:** v. 50 uses *toevah* ("abomination"), the same term as Leviticus 18:22; sexual sin is implied alongside social sin
- **Affirming:** The primary indictment is socioeconomic injustice; "abomination" is general and may not specifically reference the Genesis 19 events

## Matthew 19:4–6 / Mark 10:6–9 (Jesus on Marriage)

> He answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?" (**Matthew 19:4–5**, ESV)

- **Traditional:** Jesus explicitly defines marriage as male-female by appealing to creation order; no alternative is acknowledged or implied
- **Affirming:** The passage answers a trap question about divorce; Jesus does not address same-sex relationships and cannot be made to speak to a question he was not asked

## 1 Kings 14:24; 15:12; 22:46 — *Qedeshim*

Older English translations render *qedesh* / *qedeshim* as "sodomites"; modern translations use "cult prostitutes" or "shrine prostitutes."

- **Traditional:** The term may refer to male cult personnel who participated in same-sex acts as part of Canaanite worship; condemned alongside idolatry throughout the monarchy
- **Affirming:** *Qedesh* refers to a cultic role whose connection to same-sex activity is disputed; "sodomite" is an anachronistic and polemical translation choice not supported by the Hebrew

## David and Jonathan (1 Samuel 18–20; 2 Samuel 1:26)

> ...your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women. (**2 Samuel 1:26**, ESV)

- **Traditional:** The language reflects deep covenantal friendship and loyalty (*hesed*); the relationship is portrayed throughout as non-erotic, including their marriages to women
- **Affirming:** Some scholars argue the language of love, covenant-making, and emotional intimacy suggests a romantic dimension; this interpretation is rejected by the majority of scholars across both positions

## Ruth and Naomi (Ruth 1:16–17)

> Where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. (**Ruth 1:16**, ESV)

- **Traditional:** Ruth's declaration is an expression of covenantal loyalty (*hesed*) and family commitment between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law; no romantic element is present in the text
- **Affirming:** Very occasionally cited as an example of intimate same-sex bond language in Scripture; rejected by the vast majority of scholars on both sides as having no erotic content in context
