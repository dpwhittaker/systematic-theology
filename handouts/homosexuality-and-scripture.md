# Homosexuality and Scripture: The Primary Texts

The following passages are most frequently cited in the contemporary Christian debate on same-sex relationships. For each text, arguments from both traditional and affirming interpretive positions are listed. No conclusions are drawn.

# Genesis 1–2 (Creation Narratives)

> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. (**Genesis 1:27**, ESV)

> Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. (**Genesis 2:24**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The male-female binary is established at creation as the norm, not as a cultural arrangement
- "One flesh" union presupposes sexual complementarity between husband and wife
- Jesus himself cites Genesis 2:24 as the definition of marriage (Matt 19:4–5; Mark 10:6–9)
- Every positive biblical depiction of marriage reflects this male-female pattern
- The creation of woman from man's rib (Gen 2:21–23) emphasizes the complementarity of the sexes

**Affirming arguments:**
- The text describes what marriage is, not what it categorically cannot be
- Silence regarding same-sex relationships is not equivalent to prohibition
- Jesus cites Genesis 2:24 in the context of a divorce question, not a homosexuality question
- The passage does not address people with a same-sex orientation, which is a modern anthropological category
- Many other aspects of the creation narrative are not treated as permanent norms (e.g., single garden location, no clothing)
- The male-female pairing in 1:27–28 is explicitly tied to the command to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth"; that command has been fulfilled by humanity collectively and is no longer the governing rationale for sexual ethics

# Genesis 19 (Sodom and Gomorrah)

> And they called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them." (**Genesis 19:5**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The men of Sodom demand sexual access to Lot's guests; the intent is understood as same-sex assault
- God's judgment on the city follows immediately after this attempted violation
- New Testament writers connect Sodom's sin to sexual immorality (Jude 7; 2 Peter 2:6–7)
- The Hebrew *yada* ("know") in this context is almost certainly sexual, matching its use in Genesis 4:1, 4:17, etc.

**Affirming arguments:**
- The sin is gang rape and violent violation of hospitality, not consensual same-sex relationships
- Ezekiel 16:49 identifies Sodom's primary sin as pride, gluttony, and neglect of the poor—no mention of homosexuality
- The story addresses power, violence, and hospitality violation; it has no bearing on committed same-sex relationships
- Ancient Near Eastern hospitality laws made violation of guests an especially grave social offense—the text condemns that violation, not the gender of the victims
- Genesis 19:4 says *kol-ha'am* ("all the people of Sodom")—ESV adds "to the last man" but that phrase is not in the Hebrew; the crowd is the entire populace, not a group of men
- Genesis 19:1 identifies the visitors as *malachim* (angels), not men, and Lot bowed down (*vayishtachu*) before them—the crowd may have recognized them as supernatural beings
- This mirrors Genesis 6:1–4, where "sons of God" (angels) came to human women and the resulting corruption brought the Flood; Sodom's attempted violation of angels echoes that same human-divine boundary transgression, explaining God's targeted destruction of this specific city

# Jude 6–7

> ...just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire [*hetera sarx*], serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. (**Jude 7**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- "Unnatural desire" (*hetera sarx*, "other/strange flesh") refers to men seeking sex with men, which Jude condemns as paradigmatic of divine judgment
- The parallel with the angels (v. 6) who transgressed their created station amplifies the boundary-crossing theme
- Jude treats sexual sin as a component of Sodom's guilt alongside the Genesis account

**Affirming arguments:**
- *Hetera sarx* ("other flesh") more likely refers to the men of Sodom attempting sex with angels—beings of a literally different kind of flesh—not same-sex relations between humans
- If the condemnation is about species-crossing (human-angel), it does not speak to consensual same-sex human relationships
- The precise referent of *hetera sarx* is debated among scholars; certainty in either direction is overstated

# Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13

> You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (**Leviticus 18:22**, ESV)

> If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (**Leviticus 20:13**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The prohibition is explicit and unambiguous in its plain reading
- The Holiness Code (Lev 17–26) is widely held to contain moral, not merely ceremonial, law
- *Toevah* ("abomination") is also used for ethical violations such as deceptive scales and child sacrifice—not only ritual distinctions
- Capital punishment signals moral gravity, not merely a purity regulation
- The New Testament does not explicitly repeal or limit this prohibition

**Affirming arguments:**
- The same Holiness Code prohibits mixing fabrics, eating shellfish, and planting mixed crops—virtually all Christians treat these as not binding on Gentile believers
- *Toevah* frequently marks cultural or cultic distinctives (idolatry, pagan practices), suggesting context-specific, not universal, application
- The prohibition may specifically target cultic same-sex acts associated with Canaanite or Egyptian religious practices in view
- Paul's letters, not Leviticus, form the New Testament framework for Gentile sexual ethics

# Romans 1:18–32

> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. (**Romans 1:26–27**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- The most explicit New Testament statement on same-sex behavior, covering both women and men
- Paul frames same-sex relations as an "exchange"—a departure from God's created design
- "Against nature" (*para physin*) echoes the Genesis 1–2 creation order argument
- The condemnation appears within Paul's broader argument about universal human moral failure under God's judgment
- The context links sexual ethics to theological ethics: idolatry inverts the created order, including the sexual order

**Affirming arguments:**
- Idolatry is the sin; the same-sex behavior is explicitly a *consequence*—"for this reason (*dia touto*) God gave them up" (v. 26). Paul is describing symptoms of a prior spiritual collapse, not legislating sexual ethics
- The "downward spiral" does not bottom out at same-sex behavior; it bottoms out at gossip, strife, pride, disobedience to parents, and heartlessness (vv. 29–31)—sins universal to every reader
- Romans 2:1 is the rhetorical destination: "in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things." If the passage were primarily about homosexuality, this line would mean every judgmental reader is homosexual; the point only works if the vices listed are universal human sins
- Paul constructs the entire passage to indict self-righteous moral judgment, not to address same-sex relationships as a standalone ethical category
- *Para physin* ("against nature") may reflect Paul's Stoic cultural assumptions; the same phrase appears for men wearing long hair (1 Cor 11:14), which is not treated as a universal moral prohibition

# 1 Corinthians 6:9 — *Malakoi* and *Arsenokoitai*

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor *malakoi*, nor *arsenokoitai*... (**1 Corinthians 6:9**, ESV)

*Note: Many English Bibles render these two words together as "men who practice homosexuality" (ESV) or "homosexual offenders" (NIV). They are distinct Greek terms:*

**Traditional arguments:**
- *Arsenokoitai* is a compound of *arsēn* (male) + *koitē* (bed), directly echoing the Greek Septuagint rendering of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13—Paul likely coined it from those texts
- *Malakoi* ("soft ones") was commonly used in Greco-Roman contexts for the passive partner in male same-sex intercourse
- Together the two words may address both active and passive roles, constituting a comprehensive prohibition
- The terms represent a consistent Pauline ethic continuous with the Levitical prohibitions

**Affirming arguments:**
- *Arsenokoitai* is rare in Greek literature; earlier uses outside Paul link it to economic exploitation or coercive sex acts, not consensual relationships
- *Malakoi* more broadly denotes "morally weak," "effeminate," or "lacking self-discipline"—not necessarily sexual behavior at all
- No first-century secular text clearly uses either term to describe mutual, consensual same-sex relationships
- Modern translation choices ("homosexuals," "men who have sex with men") import 20th–21st century categories into ancient terminology

# 1 Timothy 1:8–10

> ...the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners... the sexually immoral, *arsenokoitai*, enslavers, liars, perjurers... (**1 Timothy 1:9–10**, ESV)

**Traditional arguments:**
- Consistent use with 1 Corinthians 6:9 confirms *arsenokoitai* is part of Paul's settled ethical vocabulary
- The vice list echoes the structure of the Ten Commandments, placing *arsenokoitai* within core moral law
- Pairing with "enslavers" (*andrapodistais*) may add a coercive dimension but does not eliminate the sexual referent

**Affirming arguments:**
- The same lexical uncertainty from 1 Corinthians 6:9 applies here
- Proximity to "enslavers" suggests the word may primarily target commercial sexual exploitation (slave prostitution, pederasty) rather than consensual same-sex relations
- No independent first-century definition of *arsenokoitai* conclusively covers consensual adult same-sex activity

# Science and Natural Observation

Same-sex behavior has been documented in over 1,500 animal species. Several hypotheses attempt to explain its persistence across nature.

**Population density and ecological regulation:**
- In numerous species, the rate of same-sex behavior increases as population density approaches carrying capacity—the point where additional reproduction stresses rather than sustains the population
- This pattern suggests same-sex behavior may function as a natural population regulator, an adaptive feature rather than a malfunction
- Observed in sheep, bonobos, bottlenose dolphins, various bird species, and others

**Other scientific observations:**
- The fraternal birth order effect: each additional older brother increases the statistical likelihood of homosexuality in younger brothers, possibly linked to maternal immune response during successive pregnancies
- Twin studies indicate a partial genetic component; identical twins do not show 100% concordance, suggesting multiple contributing factors (genetic, hormonal, developmental, environmental)
- No single biological cause has been identified; current scientific consensus treats sexual orientation as multifactorial and largely fixed by early development

**How each position engages the science:**

- **Traditional:** The presence of a behavior in nature does not establish a moral norm—aggression, infanticide, and dominance hierarchies also appear throughout the animal kingdom; the fall affects all creation; "natural" and "good" are not synonymous in a broken world; the image of God distinguishes human sexuality from animal behavior
- **Affirming:** If same-sex orientation is innate and potentially adaptive, it undermines the framing of homosexuality as disorder, choice, or rebellion; the population-density evidence suggests it may serve the flourishing of the broader community, consistent with a creational rather than fallen origin; "fearfully and wonderfully made" (Ps 139:14) may apply

# Final Remarks: Whole Witness vs. Trajectory

Beyond individual texts, both positions rest on broader hermeneutical frameworks.

**Traditional — The Whole Witness of Scripture:**
- No passage anywhere in Scripture depicts a same-sex relationship positively or neutrally
- Every positive portrayal of marriage and sexuality from Genesis to Revelation is male-female
- The consistent canonical pattern carries cumulative weight that individual textual debates cannot overturn
- "Silence" on same-sex relationships is itself significant—if they were acceptable, some positive example would be expected across thousands of years of sacred literature
- The creation order (Gen 1–2), reaffirmed by Jesus (Matt 19), and reflected in Paul's theology establishes a norm the rest of Scripture never contradicts

**Affirming — The Trajectory of Scripture:**
- Scripture itself shows a progressive trajectory of inclusion: Gentiles, women, slaves—each opposed by proof-texts, each eventually recognized as a move of the Spirit
- The church has overturned biblically-defended practices (slavery, segregation, silencing of women) by reading the *direction* the gospel moves rather than freezing individual texts
- The handful of texts that touch on same-sex behavior all address specific ancient contexts (cultic, exploitative, or honor-shame) with no equivalent to modern committed same-sex relationships
- The Spirit that guided the church beyond explicit texts before can do so again; hermeneutics requires asking not only "what did this mean then?" but "where is the Spirit taking the community now?"
- The greatest commandments (love God, love neighbor) and the fruit of the Spirit provide an ethical center that cannot be reduced to a list of proof-texts
