Understanding Scripture across Christian and Jewish perspectives

---

## The Struggle We All Face

You open your Bible and read that God created the world in six days. You also know that geologists date the earth at 4.5 billion years old. How do you reconcile this?

You read that women should be silent in church (1 Corinthians 14:34), but you also read that women prophesied in the early church (Acts 21:9). Which one applies today?

You read that God commands genocide against the Canaanites (Deuteronomy 20:16-17), but Jesus commands us to love our enemies (Matthew 5:44). How do these both reveal God's character?

**Some of us respond by defending literal interpretation at all costs:** "The Bible says it, I believe it, that settles it." But this creates problems with science, with culture, and sometimes seems to give us someone to hate rather than someone to love.

**Some of us respond by emphasizing cultural context:** "The Bible was written to ancient cultures. God tasks us with applying it to modern culture." But this creates a different concern—how do we distinguish faithful adaptation from dismissing what bothers us? Does the Bible still have authority if we can set aside uncomfortable parts?

**We're stuck between two fears:**
1. If we don't read literally, we'll lose biblical authority and God becomes whoever we want Him to be
2. If we do read literally, we end up with a God who contradicts science, oppresses women, and commands violence

**But what if this is a false dilemma?**

What if faithful Christians and Jews have been wrestling with these exact questions for thousands of years—and have developed approaches that:
- Maintain the authority of Scripture
- Take the text seriously without always reading it literally
- Provide guardrails against "make it mean whatever you want"
- Allow us to love God with our minds AND our hearts

This handout explores three major approaches to Scripture—**Evangelical Protestant, Mainline Protestant, and Jewish**—not to pick a winner, but to show how much we have in common and how Scripture itself supports the distinctive emphases of each.

**The surprising truth:** We agree on far more than we disagree. Our differences are mostly about *emphasis* and *degree*, not fundamental principles.

## What We ALL Agree On

Before we explore differences, let's be clear about the vast common ground across evangelical, mainline, and Jewish approaches to Scripture:

### The Bible's Divine Origin and Authority

- The Bible is the Word of God, not merely human wisdom
- The Bible has unique authority over our lives

**Biblical support:** 2 Timothy 3:16 - "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness."

### Interpretation is Complex and Requires Care

- The Bible isn't always easy to understand
- Interpretation requires wisdom, study, and care
- We can misunderstand or misapply Scripture

**Biblical support:** 2 Peter 3:16 - "There are some things in [Paul's letters] that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures."

### There are Limits to Valid Interpretation

- You can't make the Bible say anything you want
- The text itself constrains meaning

**Biblical support:** 2 Peter 3:16 (above); Galatians 1:8-9 - "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed."

### Scripture Must Be Read in Community

- Individual interpretation is insufficient
- We need to learn from other believers
- Community helps prevent error

**Biblical support:** Acts 17:11 - "Now these Jews [in Berea] were more noble...they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so." (They examined together, in community)

### The Holy Spirit Guides Understanding

- The Spirit illuminates Scripture
- Human reason alone is insufficient

**Biblical support:** John 16:13 - "When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth."

### Scripture Has a Central Message

- The Bible has unity and coherence
- There's a main storyline or theme

**Biblical support:** Luke 24:27 - "And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."

### Application Requires Wisdom

- Cultural context matters for application
- We must distinguish timeless truths from cultural forms
- Applying ancient texts to today requires discernment

**Biblical support:** James 1:5 - "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."

### Scripture Transforms Lives

- The Bible changes people
- The goal is encounter with God, not just knowledge

**Biblical support:** Hebrews 4:12 - "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."

## Where We Differ (Spoiler: It's Mostly About *Degree*, Not Essence)

With all that common ground, what do we actually disagree about?

**The short answer:** We disagree about the *relative weight* we give to four interpretive resources:

1. **The text itself** (plain reading, historical meaning)
2. **Tradition** (how the church has understood it through history)
3. **Community** (how believers today understand it together)
4. **Context** (historical, cultural, literary background)

**Every perspective uses all four.** We just emphasize them differently.

---

## Three Perspectives on Scripture

### 1. Evangelical Protestant Perspective

**Core conviction:** Scripture alone (*sola scriptura*) is our final authority. Tradition, community, and context are helpful but subordinate to what the Bible clearly says.

**Emphasis:**
- **Text first:** The plain meaning of Scripture is primary
- **Original intent:** What did the human author mean to communicate?
- **Clear over unclear:** Interpret difficult passages by clear passages
- **Grammar and context:** Careful attention to language and literary form
- **Scripture interprets Scripture:** The Bible is its own best interpreter

**What they're protecting against:**
- Church tradition overruling Scripture (as they perceive happened in medieval Catholicism)
- Cultural accommodation that waters down hard truths
- Making the Bible mean whatever we want it to mean
- Losing objective truth in favor of subjective feelings

**Their concern about other approaches:**
- Mainline: "If we let culture determine meaning, we lose biblical authority"
- Jewish: "Multiple valid meanings sounds like relativism—the text should have *one* meaning"

**Strengths:**
- High view of Scripture's authority and sufficiency
- Careful attention to what the text actually says
- Resistance to cultural captivity
- Clear methodology for interpretation

**Challenges:**
- Whose "plain reading" when Christians disagree?
- How do we handle passages that seem to contradict science or modern ethics?
- Can ignore how cultural assumptions shape our "plain reading"
- Sometimes creates a false confidence ("The Bible clearly says...") when it doesn't

**Biblical support for this emphasis:**
- **2 Timothy 3:16-17:** "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching...that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." (Scripture is *sufficient*)
- **Psalm 119:105:** "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." (Scripture *guides*)
- **Acts 17:11:** The Bereans "examined the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so." (Scripture is the *standard*)

### 2. Mainline Protestant Perspective

**Core conviction:** Scripture is authoritative, but we must interpret it through the lens of historical context, literary genre, and cultural setting. The Spirit continues to guide the church's understanding.

**Emphasis:**
- **Historical context matters:** Understanding the ancient world helps us apply Scripture rightly
- **Literary genre matters:** Poetry, prophecy, history, apocalyptic—each requires different reading
- **Progressive understanding:** The church's understanding can grow over time (e.g., slavery, women)
- **Christ as interpretive key:** Jesus' teaching of love and justice guides how we read the whole Bible
- **Reason and experience:** God gave us minds; faithful interpretation uses scholarship and lived experience

**What they're protecting against:**
- Using the Bible to justify oppression (as it was used to defend slavery, subjugate women)
- Turning the Bible into a weapon instead of good news
- Ignoring what we know about history, science, culture
- Making God smaller than our expanding understanding of His creation

**Their concern about other approaches:**
- Evangelical: "Literal reading leads to harm—defending slavery, opposing women's equality, rejecting LGBTQ people"
- Jewish: "We're Christians, not Jews—we read the Old Testament through Christ, not rabbinic tradition"

**Strengths:**
- Takes historical and cultural context seriously
- Allows Scripture to challenge cultural assumptions *and* lets new insights emerge
- Honest about difficult passages rather than defending everything literally
- Focus on the Spirit's ongoing work in the church

**Challenges:**
- How do we know when we're being faithful and when we're compromising?
- Can appear to make culture the judge of Scripture
- Risk of losing clear boundaries—what can't change?
- Sometimes sounds like "the Bible is wrong" rather than "we're reading it wrong"

**Biblical support for this emphasis:**
- **John 16:12-13:** "I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth." (The Spirit continues to *teach*)
- **Acts 15:** The Jerusalem Council changes understanding of Gentile requirements based on experience and the Spirit's leading, not just Scripture
- **Matthew 5:21-48:** Jesus says "You have heard it said...but I say to you"—bringing deeper understanding to Scripture

### 3. Jewish Perspective

**Core conviction:** Torah is God's instruction, given in relationship. It has multiple layers of meaning (PaRDeS), and each generation encounters it anew through community study and debate.

**Emphasis:**
- **Multiple valid meanings:** The text is rich enough for peshat (plain), remez (allegorical), derash (homiletical), and sod (mystical) readings simultaneously
- **Community interpretation:** The Talmud preserves centuries of rabbinic debate—both sides of arguments
- **Living text:** Scripture speaks to every generation; we discover new depths, not just recover old meanings
- **Tradition as wisdom:** Past interpretations guide but don't bind; we add our voices to the conversation
- **Wrestling, not mastering:** Engage the text like Jacob wrestling God—you walk away blessed and transformed, not victorious

**What they're protecting against:**
- Oversimplifying God's complex revelation
- Thinking we can "master" Scripture like we've figured God out
- Individual interpretation without the wisdom of community and tradition
- Closing off Scripture's ongoing voice to new situations

**Their concern about other approaches:**
- Evangelical: "Insisting on one 'correct' interpretation ignores Scripture's depths and God's complexity"
- Mainline: "Progressive revelation can't mean abandoning what came before; tradition grounds us"

**Strengths:**
- Embraces Scripture's complexity and richness
- Strong communal accountability (not private interpretation)
- Humble about human limitations in understanding God
- Allows ancient text to speak to new situations without forcing wooden application

**Challenges:**
- How do we prevent "anything goes" if multiple meanings are valid?
- Christians affirm Jesus as Messiah—how does that change our reading?
- Can sound like relativism to those trained in either/or logic
- Requires trust in community and tradition that feels risky

**Biblical support for this emphasis:**
- **Hebrews 4:12:** "For the word of God is *living* and active"—present tense, not past (Scripture is *alive*)
- **Luke 24:27:** Jesus "interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself"—showing depths they hadn't seen (Scripture has *layers*)
- **2 Peter 1:20:** "No prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation"—warning against *individual* interpretation (Community is *necessary*)
- **Matthew 18:20:** "For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them" (God meets us in *community*)

---

## Scripture's Own Support for Interpretive Resources

Here's the surprise: **The Bible itself tells us to use tradition, community, and historical context—not just the text alone.**

### Biblical Support for Valuing Tradition

- **2 Thessalonians 2:15:** "So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter." (Both oral and written apostolic teaching matter)
- **2 Timothy 2:2:** "What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also." (Chain of faithful tradition)
- **Jude 3:** "Contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints." (There's a received faith to guard)

**What this means:** We're not the first to read these texts. The church has 2,000 years of wisdom to learn from. Tradition doesn't *replace* Scripture, but it *guides* interpretation.

**See also:** 1 Corinthians 11:2; Hebrews 13:7; 1 Corinthians 4:16-17; Acts 2:42

### Biblical Support for Community Interpretation

- **2 Peter 1:20:** "No prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation." (Private interpretation is insufficient)
- **Acts 15:** The Jerusalem Council—apostles and elders *together* determined how to interpret Scripture regarding Gentiles
- **Acts 17:11:** "They received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so." (Note: "they" examined—communal activity)

**What this means:** God works through the community of believers, not just individuals. My reading should be tested by others. Lone-ranger interpretation is biblically suspect.

**See also:** Proverbs 11:14; 15:22; 1 Corinthians 12:12-27; 14:29; Ephesians 4:11-13; Matthew 18:15-20

### Biblical Support for Understanding Historical Context

- **2 Timothy 2:15:** "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth." (Requires effort and skill—including understanding context)
- **Luke 4:16-21:** Jesus reads Isaiah 61 in the synagogue and explains its fulfillment—interpreting in context of His ministry
- **1 Corinthians 8-10:** Paul discusses food sacrificed to idols—understanding *why* this mattered to Corinthians helps us apply the principle (freedom vs. love)

**What this means:** God spoke to real people in real situations. Understanding those situations helps us hear what God said and apply it faithfully.

**See also:** Nehemiah 8:8; Acts 13:16-41; Galatians 3:15-18; Psalm 137:9; Revelation (apocalyptic genre); Philemon (Roman slavery context)

## How Each Perspective Guards Against "Anything Goes"

**A common fear:** If we don't read literally, won't interpretation become subjective—making the Bible mean whatever we want?

**The answer:** All three perspectives have guardrails. They just use different ones.

### Evangelical Guardrails

**1. The text itself:** You can't make it say what the words don't say
**2. Grammar and syntax:** Language has rules; words have meanings
**3. Immediate context:** Verses mean what they mean in their literary context
**4. Whole-Bible context:** Scripture interprets Scripture; contradictions are resolved
**5. Historical-grammatical method:** Recovering original meaning provides objectivity
**6. Clear passages interpret unclear:** Don't build doctrine on obscure texts

**Example:** Some people claim the Bible supports prosperity gospel. Evangelicals respond: "The text doesn't say that. Jesus and Paul both taught suffering and sacrifice. You're reading your desires into Scripture."

### Mainline Guardrails

**1. Scholarly consensus:** What do trained biblical scholars across traditions agree on?
**2. Historical evidence:** What can we verify about ancient context?
**3. Literary genre:** Is this poetry, history, apocalyptic, parable?
**4. Jesus as interpretive lens:** Does this reading align with Christ's teaching and character?
**5. Trajectory:** Is this moving toward love, justice, liberation—or away?
**6. Community wisdom:** Does the broader church recognize this as faithful?

**Example:** Some claim the Bible condemns interracial marriage. Mainline responds: "That misreads the text's concern (religious purity, not race). Historical context shows this is about covenant faithfulness. The trajectory moves toward including outsiders (Ruth, Ethiopian eunuch, Gentiles). Jesus breaks barriers. This interpretation fails every test."

### Jewish Guardrails

**1. The text constrains:** Derash (interpretation) must connect to peshat (plain sense)
**2. Community evaluates:** Rabbis debate; not every proposal is accepted
**3. Tradition guides:** Respect what previous generations have said
**4. Coherence with Torah's spirit:** Does this align with God's character—justice, mercy, covenant faithfulness?
**5. Multiple interpretations coexist:** But not *every* interpretation—some are rejected
**6. Lived practice:** Does this interpretation lead to faithful living?

**Example:** Some might claim Jewish texts support ethnic superiority. Jewish tradition responds: "You're ignoring the plain sense of texts like Ruth and Jonah. The prophets condemn Israel's pride. Rabbinic tradition emphasizes welcoming the stranger. Your reading contradicts Torah's spirit of justice and mercy. The community rejects this."

**The point:** None of these is "anything goes." Each has robust methods for testing interpretations.

## Addressing Our Struggles

### "The Bible contradicts science"

**Evangelical response:** We may be reading Genesis more literally than the author intended. Genesis 1 is highly structured (poetry?). "Day" can mean "era." The point is *who* created, not *how long* it took. Science and Scripture answer different questions.

**Mainline response:** Genesis is ancient Near Eastern temple inauguration text, not modern science. The author used the cosmology of his day to make theological claims: God created, creation is good, humans are made in God's image. Reading it as science textbook misses the point and creates false conflicts.

**Jewish response:** Torah has multiple levels. Peshat (plain sense) describes God's creative acts. Derash explores *why* six days (pattern for Sabbath). Sod contemplates God's transcendence. We don't force ancient text into modern categories.

**Common ground:** All three say we need to understand *what kind of literature* we're reading. Forcing Genesis to answer scientific questions it wasn't asking creates unnecessary conflict.

### "The Bible oppresses women"

**Evangelical response:** Some commands were culturally specific (head coverings). Others are permanent (complementary roles). We distinguish cultural form from timeless principle. The Bible elevates women compared to surrounding cultures. We apply principles, not just copy ancient practices.

**Mainline response:** Scripture shows progression—from patriarchy toward equality. Jesus and Paul radically elevated women's status in their contexts. The trajectory points toward equality. We continue that trajectory, recognizing cultural limitations in the text while honoring its liberating direction.

**Jewish response:** Torah reflects patriarchal culture but also protects women (compared to surrounding nations). Rabbinic tradition debates and sometimes revises earlier practices. We honor the text while recognizing we live in a different context. The text speaks anew to each generation.

**Common ground:** All three recognize cultural context matters. We don't just copy ancient practices. We seek to honor God's heart for justice while living faithfully in our time.

### "Literal reading gives people someone to hate"

**Evangelical response:** Faithful interpretation doesn't lead to hate—*unfaithful* interpretation does. When people use the Bible to justify hatred, they're misreading it. Jesus commands us to love enemies. Any reading that produces hate is wrong.

**Mainline response:** We agree. When "literal reading" leads to hate, we're not reading literally enough—we're ignoring Jesus' clear commands to love. The problem isn't literalism per se; it's selective literalism that ignores inconvenient commands.

**Jewish response:** When interpretation produces hate rather than love of neighbor, it fails the test of coherence with Torah's spirit. "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18) is foundational. Any reading contradicting this is rejected.

**Common ground:** All three agree: If your interpretation leads to hatred, you're misreading Scripture. The Bible's central message is God's love and our call to love others.

### "We can't let the Bible mean whatever we want"

**Evangelical response:** Exactly. That's why we stick to the text's plain meaning and use historical-grammatical method. Objectivity comes from careful reading and clear methodology.

**Mainline response:** Agreed. That's why we use scholarly tools, community wisdom, and test interpretations against Jesus' teaching. We can't just make it say what we want.

**Jewish response:** Right. That's why community interprets, tradition guides, and the text itself constrains. Not every proposed interpretation is accepted. We have standards.

**Common ground:** All three resist relativism. We all believe in faithful vs. unfaithful interpretation. We just use different guardrails.

---

## So Where Does This Leave Us?

### Humility

**None of us has corner on truth.** Evangelicals can read too literally and miss deeper meaning. Mainline can over-accommodate culture and lose biblical authority. Jewish interpretation can seem relative to outsiders.

**We need each other.** Evangelicals keep mainline tethered to the text. Mainline keeps evangelicals from wooden literalism. Jewish tradition reminds us both that Scripture is richer than we think.

**Scripture itself calls for humility:**
- **1 Corinthians 13:12:** "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known."
- **Proverbs 3:5-7:** "Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Be not wise in your own eyes."

### Grace

**We can disagree and still be family.** Our differences are real but not ultimate. We worship the same God, trust the same Christ, read the same Scripture.

**Scripture calls us to unity despite differences:**
- **Romans 14:1-4:** "As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions...Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls."
- **Ephesians 4:2-3:** "With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."

### Wisdom

**Context matters.** Not everything applies the same way in every situation. Distinguishing timeless truth from cultural form requires wisdom.

**Genre matters.** Poetry, prophecy, apocalyptic, history, parable—each requires different reading.

**The Spirit guides.** We're not left to figure this out alone. God helps us understand His Word.

### Trust

**God is bigger than our interpretive methods.** Whether we emphasize text, tradition, community, or context—God can speak through all of these.

**The Bible is robust.** It's survived 2,000+ years of interpretation—literal, allegorical, historical-critical, liberation, feminist, postmodern. God's Word endures.

**We can trust Scripture without having it all figured out.** Mystery isn't failure. God is infinite; our understanding is finite. That's okay.

---

## A Word for Our Class

If you're wrestling with these questions, here's what I want you to know:

**Your questions are faithful, not faithless.** Wrestling with Scripture is *honoring* it, not doubting it. Jacob wrestled with God and was blessed.

**You don't have to choose between science and Scripture.** Faithful Christians and Jews read Genesis differently than modern scientific textbooks—and that's not compromise, it's wisdom.

**You don't have to agree with everyone to fellowship with them.** We can hold different views on secondary matters and still worship together, pray together, love each other as brothers and sisters.

**Your concern about authority is valid.** We need guardrails. But text-only, tradition-only, or community-only—all have limits. Scripture itself points us to use all three.

**Your concern about hate is valid too.** When Bible interpretation produces hatred of others, something has gone wrong. Jesus commands love. Any reading contradicting that fails.

**The goal isn't to "master" the Bible.** It's to encounter God through Scripture. To be shaped, challenged, comforted, transformed. The Bible isn't a textbook to ace; it's living Word from a living God.

**We're in this together.** Evangelical, mainline, Jewish—we're all trying to hear God's voice faithfully. We can learn from each other. We need each other's gifts, perspectives, and wisdom.

---

## Three Questions for Reflection

**1. Which perspective do you lean toward naturally? What does that perspective help you see? What might it cause you to miss?**

**2. What from the other two perspectives challenges you? What might God be teaching you through that challenge?**

**3. How might understanding these three perspectives help you engage more graciously with Christians who read the Bible differently than you do?**

---

## Conclusion: The Word of the Lord

At the end of the day, across all our differences, one thing unites us:

**We believe this is the Word of the Lord.**

Not just ancient human wisdom. Not merely inspiring literature. The living God has spoken. These words matter. They have authority over us. They reveal truth about God, about ourselves, about how to live.

**We take this seriously—all of us.**

We just recognize that taking Scripture seriously doesn't mean reading it the same way. Faithful people can disagree on method while agreeing on authority.

**So let's:**
- Listen humbly to how others read
- Learn from traditions not our own
- Test our interpretations in community
- Hold our methods with open hands
- Cling to Christ with closed fists

**May we read Scripture:**
- With reverence for its divine origin
- With honesty about its human composition
- With humility about our limited understanding
- With openness to the Spirit's guidance
- With commitment to live what we learn
- With grace toward those who read differently

**And may God, who breathed out these Scriptures, guide us into all truth.**

*"The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple."* - Psalm 119:130
